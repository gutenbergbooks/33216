CHAPTER I.
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Hôtel des Princes, Paris</i>.
</h3>
<p>
It is a strange thing to begin a &ldquo;Log&rdquo; when the voyage is nigh ended! A
voyage without chart or compass has it been: and now is land in sight&mdash;the
land of the weary and heart-tired!
</p>
<p>
Here am I, at the Hôtel des Princes, <i>en route</i> for Italy, whither my
doctors have sentenced me! What a sad record would be preserved to the
world if travellers were but to fill up, with good faith, the police
formula at each stage of the journey, which asks, &ldquo;the object of the
tour!&rdquo; How terribly often should we read the two short words&mdash;&ldquo;To
Die.&rdquo; With what sorrowful interest would one gaze at the letters formed by
a trembling hand; and yet how many would have to write them! Truly, the
old Italian adage, &ldquo;<i>Vedere Napole es poi morire</i>&rdquo; has gained a new
signification; and, unhappily, a far more real one.
</p>
<p>
This same practice of physicians, of sending their patients to linger out
the last hours of life in a foreign land, is, to my thinking, by no means
so reprehensible as the generality of people make out. It is a theme,
however, on which so many commonplaces can be strung, that common-place
people, who, above all others, love their own eloquence, never weary of
it. Away from his children&mdash;from his favourite haunts&mdash;from the
doctors that understood his case&mdash;from his comfortable house&mdash;from
the family apothecary,&mdash;such are the changes they ring; and if dying
were to be done often, there would be much reason in all this. But it is
not so; this same change occurs but once, and its approach brings with it
a new train of thoughts and feelings from all that we have ever felt
before. In that twilight hour of life, objects that have escaped our
vision in the blaze of noon-day become clear and distinct; and, even to
the least reflecting of minds, an increased power of perception and
judgment is accorded&mdash;the <i>viaticum</i> for the coming journey!
</p>
<p>
I remember being greatly affected by the stories in the &ldquo;Diary of a
Physician,&rdquo; when first I read them: they were powerfully written&mdash;and
<i>so real!</i> Now this is the very quality they want: they are
altogether unreal.
</p>
<p>
Terrific and heart-stirring as the death-bed scenes are, they are not true
to nature: the vice and the virtue are alike exaggerated. Few, very few
persons can bring themselves by an effort to believe that they are dying&mdash;easy
as it seems, often as we talk of it, frequent as the very expression
becomes in a colloquialism, it is still a most difficult process; but once
thoroughly felt, there is an engrossing power, in the thought that
excludes all others.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
At times, indeed, Hope will triumph for a brief interval, and &ldquo;tell of
bright days to come.&rdquo; Hope! the glorious phantom that we follow up the
Rhine&mdash;through the deep glens of the Tyrol, and over the Alps!&mdash;Only
content to die when we have lost it!
</p>
<p>
There are men to whom the truth, however shocking, is always revealed&mdash;to
whom the Lawyer says, &ldquo;You have no case,&rdquo; and the Physician confesses,
&ldquo;You have no constitution.&rdquo; Happily or unhappily&mdash;I will not deny it
may be both&mdash;I am one of these. Of the three doctors summoned to
consult on my health, one spoke confidently and cheeringly; he even
assumed that kind of professional jocularity that would imply, &ldquo;the
patient is making too much of it.&rdquo; The second, more reserved from
temperament, and graver, counselled caution and great care&mdash;hinted at
the danger of the malady&mdash;coupling his fears with the hopes he
derived from the prospect of climate. The third (he was younger than
either of the others, and of inferior repute,) closed the door after them,
and resumed his seat.
</p>
<p>
I waited for some time expecting him to speak, but he sat in silence, and
seemingly in deep thought. &ldquo;And you, my dear doctor,&rdquo; said I at length,
&ldquo;are you equally confident as your learned colleagues? Will the air of
Italy&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; He lifted up his eyes as I got so far, and their
expression I shall not readily forget&mdash;so softly tender, so full of
compassionate pity, did they beam. Never did a look convey more of
sorrowing regret, nor more of blank despair. I hesitated&mdash;-on <i>his</i>
account I feared to finish what I had begun; but, as if replying to the
expression of his glance, I added, &ldquo;But still you advise me to go? You
counsel the journey, at least?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He blushed deeply before he could answer. He felt ashamed that he had
failed in one great requisite of his art. I hastened to relieve him, by
saying with a joyous air, &ldquo;Well, I will go. I like the notion myself; it
is at least a truce with physic. It is like drawing a game before one has
completely lost it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And so here I am&mdash;somewhat wearied and fevered by the unaccustomed
exertion, but less so than I expected.
</p>
<p>
I sincerely hope it is only the fastidiousness of a sick man, and not that
most insufferable of all affectations&mdash;exclusiveness; but I will own
I never disliked the mixed company of a steam-boat so much before. It is
always an unpleasant part of our English travelling-experience, that
little steam trip from our own coast to the French or Belgian shore. The
pleasuring Cockney, only sufferable when sick&mdash;the runaway Bank clerk&mdash;the
Hamburg Jew&mdash;the young lady going to Paris for spring fashions&mdash;the
newly-married barrister, with his bit of tawdry finery from Norwood,
silly, simpering, and fidgetty&mdash;the Irish landlord, sulky and
familiar by turns; all, even to the <i>Danseuse</i>, who, too refined for
such association, sits in her carriage on deck, have a terrible sameness
when seen, as I have done them, something like fifty times; nor can I
suppose their united attractions greatly heightened by the figure of the
pale gentleman, who coughs so incessantly, and whose wan cheek and
colourless eye are seen to such formidable contrast with the bronzed and
resolute face of the courier beside him.
</p>
<p>
Yet I would far rather think this want of due tolerance for my travelling
companions was a symptom of my malady, than of that truly English disease&mdash;self-importance,
I know of nothing that tracks our steps on the Continent so invariably,
nor is there any quality which earns for us so much ill-will.
</p>
<p>
It is quite a mistake to suppose that these airs of superiority are only
assumed by persons of a certain rank and fortune&mdash;far from it. Every
denizen of Cheapside and the Minories that travels abroad, deems himself
immeasurably above &ldquo;the foreigner.&rdquo; Strong in his City estimation, and
charged with the leader in &ldquo;The Times,&rdquo; he struts about like an upstart
visiting the servants&rsquo; hall, and expecting every possible demonstration of
respect in return for his condescension. Hence the unhappy disparity
between the situation of an Englishman and that of any other native
abroad. Instead of rejoicing at any casualty which presents to him a
chance-meeting with a countryman, he instinctively shrinks from it. He
sees the Frenchman, the Italian, the German, overjoyed at recognition with
some stranger from his own land, while <i>he</i> acknowledges, in such a
contingency, only another reason for guardedness and caution. It is not
that our land is wanting in those sterling qualities which make men
respected and venerated&mdash;it is not that we are not, from principle
and practice, both more exacting in all the requisites of good faith, and
more tenacious of truth, than any people of the Continent;&mdash;it is
simply that we are the least tolerant to every thing that differs from
what we have at home, that we unscrupulously condemn whatever is
un-English; and, not satisfied with this, we expect foreigners to respect
and admire us for the very censure we pass upon their institutions.
</p>
<p>
There is, therefore, nothing so compromising to an Englishman abroad as a
countryman; except&mdash;<i>hélas</i> that I should say so!&mdash;a
countrywoman!
</p>
<p>
Paris is very beautiful in spring. There is something radiant and gorgeous
in the commingled splendour of a great city, with the calmer beauties of
leafy foliage and the sparkling eddies of the bright river. Better,
however, not to dwell longer on this theme, lest my gloomy thoughts should
stray into the dark and crime-trodden alleys of the Bois de Boulogne, or
the still more terrible filets de St. Cloud! How sad is it when one&rsquo;s
temperament should, as if instinctively, suggest the mournful view of each
object! Rather let me jot down a little incident of this morning&mdash;an
event which has set my heart throbbing, and my pulse fluttering, at a rate
that all the Prussic acid I have learned to take cannot calm down again.
</p>
<p>
There come now and then moments to the sick man, when to be well and
vigorous he would consent to be poor, unfriended in the world&mdash;taking
health alone for his heritage. I felt that half an hour ago&mdash;but it
is gone again. And now to my adventure, for, in my unbroken dream of daily
life, it seems such.
</p>
<p>
I have said I am lodged at the Hôtel des Princes. How different are my
quarters from those I inhabited when first I saw this city! This would
entail a confession, however, and I shall make it some other day. My salon
is No. 21, the first drawing-room to the right as you turn from the grand
staircase, and opening by the three spacious windows on a balcony
overlooking the Rue de Richlieu. It is, indeed, a very splendid apartment,
as much so as immense mirrors, gilding, bronze, and or moulu can make it.
There are soft couches and chairs, and ottomans too, that would inspire
rest, save when the soul itself was restless.
</p>
<p>
Well. I lounged out after breakfast for a short stroll along the
Boulevards, where the shade of the trees and the well-watered path were
most inviting. Soon wearied&mdash;I cannot walk in a crowd&mdash;I
returned to the hôtel; slowly toiled up-stairs, waking the echoes with my
teasing cough; and, instead of turning to the right, I went left, taking
the wrong road, as I have so often done in life; and then, mistaking the
numerals, I entered No. 12 instead of No. 21. Who would credit it, that
the misplacement of a unit could prove so singular.
</p>
<p>
There was one change alone which struck me. I could not find the book I
was reading&mdash;a little volume of Auerbach&rsquo;s village stories of the
Schwartz-Walders. There was, however, another in its place, one that told
of humble life in the provinces&mdash;not less truthful and
heart-appealing&mdash;but how very unlike! It was Balzac&rsquo;s story of
&ldquo;Eugénie Grandet,&rdquo; the most touching tale I have ever read in any
language. I have read it a hundred times, and ever with renewed delight.
Little troubling myself to think how it came there&mdash;for, like an old
and valued friend, its familiar features were always welcome&mdash;I began
again to read it.
</p>
<p>
Whether the result of some peculiar organisation, or the mere consequence
of ill health, I know not, but I have long remarked, that when a book has
taken a strong hold upon me&mdash;fascinating my attention and engaging
all my sympathies, I cannot long continue its perusal. I grow dreary and
speculative; losing the thread of the narrative, I create one for myself,
imagining a variety of incidents and scenes quite foreign to the intention
of the writer, and identifying myself usually with some one personage or
other of the story&mdash;till the upshot of all is, I drop off asleep, to
awake an hour or so afterwards with a very tired brain, and a very
confused sense of the reality or unreality of my last waking sensations.
</p>
<p>
It is, therefore, rather a relief to me, when, as in the present case, the
catastrophe is known to me, and all speculation on the future denied. Poor
Eugénie, how I felt for all your sorrows!&mdash;wondrous spectacle of a
heart that could transmute its one absorbing passion into another, and
from love, the fondest and most confiding, beget a pure and disinterested
friendship!
</p>
<p>
At last the book glided unnoticed from my hand, and I slept. The sofa
where I lay stood in a part of the room where a deep shadow fell from the
closed <i>jalousies</i> of a window, so that any person might easily have
entered or traversed the apartment without noticing me. I slept calmly and
without a stir&mdash;my dreaming thoughts full of that poor girl&rsquo;s love.
How little does any first passion depend upon the excellence of the object
that creates it! How ideal, purely ideal, are those first emotions of the
heart! I knew something of this, too; for, when young&mdash;very young,
and very impressionable, with a strong dash of romance in my nature, that
lent its Claude Lorraine tint to all I looked at, I fell in love. Never
was the phrase more fitting. It was no gradual or even imperceptible
declension, but a headlong, reckless plunge; such as some confident and
hardy swimmer, or very often a bold bather, makes into the water, that all
may be quickly over.
</p>
<p>
I had been appointed <i>attaché</i> at Vienna, where Lord Newington was
then ambassador&mdash;a widower with an only daughter. I was very young,
fresh from Woolwich, where I had been studying for the Artillery service,
when the death of a distant relative, who but a year before had refused to
see me, put me in possession of a very large fortune. My guardian, Lord
Elderton, an old <i>diplomate</i>, at once removed me from Woolwich, and,
after a short sojourn at his house near Windsor, I was introduced into
what Foreign-office people technically denominate &ldquo;The Line,&rdquo; and what
they stoutly uphold as the only career for a gentleman.
</p>
<p>
I must some day or other jot down a few recollections of my life at
Gortham, Lord Elderton&rsquo;s seat, where, with Grotius and Puffendorf of a
morning, and old Sir Robert Adams and Lord Hailiebury of an evening, I was
believed to be inhaling the very atmosphere of learned diplomacy. Tiresome
old gentlemen, whose thoughts stood fast at the time of Fox and Pitt, and,
like a clock that went down in the night, steadily pointed to an hour long
bygone. How wearied I was of discussions as to whether the King of Prussia
would declare war, or the Emperor of Austria make peace! whether we should
give up Malta, and lose Hanover! Pitt must, indeed, have been a man of
&ldquo;dark counsels,&rdquo; for, whether he wished for an alliance with France or not
was a nightly topic of debate, without a chance of agreement.
</p>
<p>
All these discussions, far from tending to excite my ardour for the
career, served to make me dread it, as the most tiresome of all possible
pursuits. The light gossip, too, over which they regaled themselves with
such excellent relish, was insupportably dull. Who could care for the
pointless repartees of defunct Grand Dukes, or the meaningless caprices of
long-buried Archduchesses?
</p>
<p>
If, then, I was glad to escape from Gortham and its weary company, I had
formed no very sanguine expectations of pleasure at Vienna.
</p>
<p>
I saw very little of the Continent in this my first journey. I was
consigned to the charge of a cabinet messenger, who had orders to deliver
me &ldquo;safe&rdquo; at Vienna. Poor M&rsquo;Kaye, slight as I was, he left me very little
of the small <i>coupé</i> we travelled in. He weighed something more than
twenty stone, a heaving mass of fat and fretting: the great misery of his
life being that Washington Irving had held him up to European ridicule,
for he was the original &ldquo;Stout Gentleman&rdquo; whose heavy perambulations
overhead suggested that inimitable sketch.
</p>
<p>
We arrived at Vienna some hours after dark, and after speedily traversing
the narrow and winding streets of the capital, drew up within the <i>porte-cochère</i>
of the English embassy. There was a grand ball at the embassy&mdash;a
sovereign&rsquo;s birth-day, or a coronation, I forget which&mdash;but I can
well remember the dazzling splendour of the grand staircase, a blaze of
wax-lights, and glittering with the brilliant lustre of jewelled dresses
and gorgeous uniforms; but, perhaps, even more struck by the frequent
announcement of names which were familiar to me as almost historical
personages&mdash;the Ester-hazies, the Schwarzenbergs, and the
Lichtensteins, when suddenly, with almost a shock, I heard my own untitled
name called aloud, &ldquo;Mr. Horace Templeton.&rdquo; It is, I believe, a very old
gentry name, and has maintained a fair repute for some half-dozen
centuries; but, I own, it clinked somewhat meagre on the ear amid the
high-sounding syllables of Austrian nobility.
</p>
<p>
I stood within the doorway of the grand salon, almost stunned by the
sudden transition from the dark monotony of a night-journey to the noonday
blaze of splendour before me, when a gentle tap from a bouquet on my arm
aroused me, and a very silvery voice, in accents every one of which sank
into my heart, bade me welcome to Vienna. It was Lady Blanche Newington
that spoke&mdash;the most lovely creature that ever beauty and station
combined to form. Fascinations like hers were new to me: she mingled
gentleness of manner with a spiritual liveliness, that seemed ever ready
to say the right thing at the right moment. The ease with which, in
different languages, she addressed the various individuals of the company,
employing all the little delicate forms of those conventionalities French
and Italian so abound in, and through all, an unobtrusive solicitude to
please, that was most captivating.
</p>
<p>
My whole occupation that night was to steal after her unobserved, and gaze
with delight at traits of manner that my ardent imagination had already
elevated into graces of mind. I was very much in love&mdash;so much so
that, ere a few weeks went over, iny brother attachés saw it, and
tormented me unceasingly on the subject. Nay, they went further: they
actually told Lady Blanche herself, so that I dreaded to meet her, not
knowing how she might treat my presumption. I fancied all manner of
changes in her bearing towards me&mdash;reserve, coldness, perhaps
disdain. Nothing of the kind! She was only more familiar and cordial than
ever. Had I known more of the world, or of the feminine part of it, I
should have read this differently: as it was, it overwhelmed me with
delight. There was a frankness in her tone towards me, too; for, now, she
discussed the temper and character of our mutual acquaintances, and with a
shrewdness of criticism strange in one so young. At last we came to talk
of a certain Count de Favancourt, the secretary of the French embassy; and
as I mentioned his name she said, somewhat abruptly,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I half suspect you don&rsquo;t like the Count?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who could?&rdquo; replied I, eagerly; &ldquo;is he not a &lsquo;<i>Fat?</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;using
that precious monosyllable by which his countrymen designate a certain
class of pretenders.
</p>
<p>
She laughed, and I went on, not sorry to have an opportunity of severity
on one for whom I had conceived an especial hatred&mdash;indeed, not
altogether without cause, since he had, on more than one occasion, marked
the difference of our official rank in a manner sufficiently pointed to be
offensive;
</p>
<p>
and yet, the rigid etiquette observable to another embassy forbade all
notice of whatever could be passed over.
</p>
<p>
Like a very young man, I did not bound my criticism on the Count by what I
saw and observed in his manner, but extended it to every possible
deduction I could draw from his air and bearing; winding up all by a very
broadly-hinted doubt that those ferocious whiskers and that deep baritone
were any thing but a lion&rsquo;s skin over a very craven heart.
</p>
<p>
The last words were scarcely uttered, when a servant announced the Count
de Favancourt. There is something, to a young person at least&mdash;I
fancy I should not mind it now&mdash;so overwhelming on the sudden
appearance of any one on whom the conversation has taken a turn of
severity, that I arose confused and uneasy&mdash;I believe I blushed; at
all events, I perceived that Lady Blanche remarked my discomfiture, and
her eyes glanced on me with an expression I never observed before. As for
the Count, he advanced and made his deep reverence without ever noticing
me, nor, even while taking his seat, once shewed any consciousness of my
presence.
</p>
<p>
Burning with indignation that I could scarce repress, I turned towards a
table, and affected to occupy myself tossing over the prints and drawings
that lay about&mdash;my maddened thoughts rendered still more insufferable
from fancying that Lady Blanche and the Count seemed on far better and
more intimate footing than I had ever known them before.
</p>
<p>
Some other visitors being announced, I took the occasion to retire
unobserved, and had just reached the landing of the stairs when I heard a
foot behind me. I turned&mdash;it was Favancourt. For the first time in my
life, I perceived a smile upon his countenance&mdash;an expression, I own,
that became it even less than his habitual stern scowl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have done me the honour, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to make some observations on
my manner, which, I regret to learn, has not acquired your favourable
opinion. Now, I have a strong sense of the <i>inconvenance</i> of any
thing like a rupture of amicable relations between the embassy I have the
honour to serve and that to which you belong. It is, then, exceedingly
unpleasant for me to notice your remarks&mdash;it is impossible for me to
let them pass unnoticed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He made a pause at these words, and so long that I felt bound to speak,
and, in a voice that passion had rendered slightly tremulous, said,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I to receive this, sir, in the light of a rebuke? because, as yet, I
only perceive it conveys the expression of your own regret that you cannot
demand an explanation I am most ready to afford you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My demand is somewhat different, sir, but, I trust, will be as readily
accorded. It is this: that you resign your position as <i>attaché</i> to
this embassy, and leave Vienna at once. There is no necessity that any
unfavourable notice of this affair should follow you to another mission,
or to England.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop, sir, I beg of you: I cannot be answerable for my temper, if you
persist to outrage it. While you may press me to acknowledge that, while
half an hour ago I only deemed you a &lsquo;Fat,&rsquo; I now account you an
imbecile.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; said the Count, passing down the stairs before me.
</p>
<p>
When I reached my lodgings, I found a &ldquo;friend&rdquo; from him, who arranged a
speedy meeting. We fought that same evening, behind the Prater, and I
received his ball in my shoulder&mdash;mine, pierced his hat. I was
recalled before my wound permitted me to leave my bed. The day I left
Vienna, Lady Blanche was married to Count Favancourt!
</p>
<p>
Some fourteen years had elapsed since that event and the time in which I
now lay sleeping on the sofa; and yet, after all that long interval&mdash;with
all its scenes of varied interests, its stormy passions, its hopes, its
failures, its successes&mdash;the image of Blanche was before my mind&rsquo;s
eye, as brightly, joyously fair, as on the evening I first beheld her. I
had forgotten all, that time and worldly knowledge had taught me, that, of
all her attractions, her beauty only was real&mdash;that the graceful
elegance of her bearing was only manner&mdash;that her gentleness was
manner&mdash;her winning softness and delicacy mere manner&mdash;that all
the fair endowments that seemed the rich promise of a gifted mind, united
to a nature so bounteously endowed, were mere manner. She was <i>spirituelle</i>,
lively, animated, and brilliant&mdash;all, from nothing but manner. To
this knowledge I did not come without many a severe lesson. The teaching
has been perfect, however, and made me what I am! Alas! how is it that
mere gilding can look so like solid gold&mdash;nay, be made to cover more
graceful tracery, and forms more purely elegant, than the real metal?
</p>
<p>
I have said that I slept; and, as I lay, dreams came over me&mdash;dreams
of that long-past time, when the few shadows that fell over my path in
life were rather spots where, like the traveller on a sunny road, one
halts to breathe awhile, and taste in the cool shade the balmy influence
of repose. I thought of Blanche, too, as first I had seen her, and when
first she taught my heart to feel the ecstasy of loving, breathing into my
nature high hopes and longings, and making of life itself an ideal of
delight and happiness. And, as I dreamed, there stole over my senses a
faint, thrilling memory of that young joy my heart had known, and a
feeling like that of health and ardent buoyancy, which for years long I
had not experienced. <i>Her</i> voice, tremulous with feeling, vibrating
in all the passionate expression of an Italian song, was in my ears&mdash;I
could hear the words&mdash;my very heart throbbed to their soft syllables
as she sung the lines of Metastasio,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;E tu, qui sa si te
Ti sovrerai  di  me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
I started&mdash;there she was before me, bending over the harp, whose
cords still trembled with the dying sounds; the same Blanche I had known
and loved, but slightly changed indeed: more beautiful perhaps in
womanhood than as a girl. Her long and silky hair fell over her white
wrist and taper hand in loose and careless tresses, for she had taken off
her bonnet, which lay on the floor beside her; her attitude was that of
weariness&mdash;nay, there was a sigh! Good Heavens! is she weeping? My
book fell to the ground; she started up, and, in a voice not louder than a
whisper, exclaimed, &ldquo;Mr. Templeton!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Blanche!&mdash;Lady Blanche!&rdquo; cried I, as my head swam round in a strange
confusion, and a dim and misty vapour danced before my eyes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is this a visit, Mr. Templeton?&rdquo; said she, with that soft smile I had
loved so well; &ldquo;am I to take this surprise for a visit?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I really&mdash;I cannot understand&mdash;I thought&mdash;I was certain
that I was in my own apartment. I believed I was in Paris, in the Hôtel
des Princes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and most correct were all your imaginings; only that at this moment
you are <i>chez moi</i>&mdash;this is our apartment, No. 12.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, forgive me, I beg, Lady Blanche!&mdash;the similarity of the rooms,
the inattentive habit of an invalid, has led to this mistake.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I heard you had been ill,&rdquo; said she, in an accent full of melting
tenderness; while taking a seat on a sofa, by a look rather than an actual
gesture she motioned me to sit beside her: &ldquo;you are much paler than you
used to be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have been ill,&rdquo; said I, struggling to repress emotion and a fit of
coughing together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is that dreadful life of England, depend upon it,&rdquo; said she eagerly;
&ldquo;that fearful career of high excitement and dissipation combined&mdash;the
fatigues of parliament&mdash;the cares and anxieties of party&mdash;the
tremendous exertions for success&mdash;the torturing dread of failure. Why
didn&rsquo;t you remain in diplomacy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It looked so very like idling,&rdquo; said I, laughingly, and endeavouring to
assume something of her own easy tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So it is. But what better can one have, after all?&rdquo; said she, with a
faint sigh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When they are happy,&rdquo; added I, stealing a glance at her beneath my
eyelids. She turned away, however, before I had succeeded, and I could
merely mark that her breathing was quick and hurried.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope you have no grudge towards Favancourt?&rdquo; said she hastily, and with
a manner that shewed how difficult it was to disguise agitation. &ldquo;He would
be delighted to see you again! He is always talking of your success in the
House, and often prophesies the most brilliant advancement for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have outlived resentment,&rdquo; said I, in a low whisper: &ldquo;would that I
could add, other feelings were as easily forgotten.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Not at once catching my meaning, she turned her full and lustrous eyes
upon me, and then suddenly aware of my words, or reading the explanation
in my own looks, she blushed deeply, and after a pause said,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what are your plans now? do you remain here some time?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I am trying to reach Italy. It has become as classic to die there
nowadays, as once it was to live in that fair land.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Italy!&rdquo; interrupted she, blushing still deeper. &ldquo;Favancourt is now asking
for a mission there&mdash;Naples is vacant.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This time I succeeded in catching her eyes, but she hastily withdrew them,
and we were both silent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you been to the Opera yet?&rdquo; said she, with a voice full of all its
habitual softness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; said I, smiling, &ldquo;that I am an invalid: besides, I only
arrived here last night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I am sure that much will not fatigue you. The Duc de Blancard has
given us his box while we stay here, and we shall always have a place for
you; and I pray you to come; if not for the music, for my sake,&rdquo; she added
hastily: &ldquo;for I own nothing can be possibly more stupid than our nightly
visitors. I hear of nothing but ministerial intrigue, the tactics of the
<i>centre droit</i> and the opposition, with a little very tiresome gossip
of the Tuileries; and Favancourt thinks himself political, when he is only
prosy. Now, I long for a little real chit-chat about London and our own
people. <i>Apropos</i>, what became of Lady Frances Gunnington? did she
really marry the young cornet of dragoons and sail for India?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The saddest is to be told: he was killed in the Punjaub, and she is now
coming home a widow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How very sad!&mdash;was she as pretty as they said?&mdash;handsomer than
Lucy Fox I have heard!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I almost think so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is great praise from you, if there be any truth in <i>on dits</i>.
Had not you a kind of tenderness in that quarter?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t affect surprise: we heard the story at Florence, and a very
funny story it was: that Lucy insisted upon it, if you didn&rsquo;t propose for
her, that she would for you, since she was determined to be mistress of a
certain black Arabian that you had; and that you, fearing consequences,
sent her the horse, and so compromised the affair.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How very absurd!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But is it not true? Can you deny having made a present of the steed?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She did me the honour to accept of a pony, but the attenuating
circumstances are all purely imaginary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Si non vero e ben trovato</i>.&mdash;It was exactly what she would
do!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;An unfair inference, which I feel bound to enter a protest against. If we
were only to charge our acquaintances with what we deem them capable of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, finish, I pray you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was only about to add, what would become of ourselves?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Meaning you and me, for instance?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I bowed an assent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Qui s&rsquo;excuse, s&rsquo;accuse</i>,&rsquo; says the adage,&rdquo; rejoined she gaily: &ldquo;I
neither do one nor the other. At the same time, let me confess to one
thing of which I am capable, which is, of detesting any one who in this
age of the world affects to give a tone of moralizing to a conversation.
Now I presume you don&rsquo;t wish this. I will even take it for granted, that
you would rather we were good friends, as we used to be long ago.&mdash;Oh
dear, don&rsquo;t sigh that way!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was you that sighed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I am very sorry for it. It was wrong of <i>me</i>, and very wrong
of <i>you</i> to tell me of it. But dear me! is it so late? can it really
be three o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am a quarter past; but I think we must both be fast. You are going
out?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A mere drive in the Champs Elysées, where I shall pay a few visits and be
back to dinner. Will you dine with us?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I pray you to excuse me&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget I am a sick man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, we shall see you at the Opera?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I fear not. If I might ask a favour, it would be to take the volume of
Balzac away with me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, to be sure! But we have some others, much newer. You know &lsquo;Le
Recherche de l&rsquo;Absolu&rsquo;, already?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but I like &lsquo;Eugénie&rsquo; still better. It was an old taste of mine, and
as you quoted a proverb a few moments ago, let me give you another as
trite and as true,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
‘On revient toujours.&rsquo;&rdquo;

&ldquo;&lsquo;A ses premières amours,&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
said she, finishing; while with a smile, half playful, half sad, she
turned toward the window, and I retired noiselessly, and without an adieu.
</p>
<p>
Heigho! how nervous and irritable I feel! The very sight of that handsome
barouche that has driven from the hôtel, with its beautiful occupant lying
listlessly back among the cushions, has set my heart a-beating far far too
hurriedly. How is it that the laws that govern material nature are so
inoperative in ours, and that a heart that never felt can make another
feel? Heaven knows! It is not love; even my first passion, perhaps, little
merited the name: but now, reading her as worldliness as taught roe to
do-seeing how little relation exists between attractions and fascinations
of the very highest order and any real sentiment, any true feeling&mdash;knowing
how &ldquo;Life&rdquo; is her idol, how in that one idea is comprised all that vanity,
self-love, false pride, and passion can form,&mdash;how is it that she,
whom I recognise thus, that <i>she</i> can move me? There is nothing so
like a battle as a sham fight in a review.

<h2>
CHAPTER II.
</h2>
<p>
I must leave Paris at once. The weather is intolerably hot; the leaves
that were green ten days ago already are shewing symptoms of the sear and
yellow. Is it in compliment to the august inhabitant of the palace that
the garden is so <i>empressé</i> to turn its coat? Shame on my ingratitude
to say so! for I find that his Majesty has sent me a card of invitation to
dine on Friday next. Another reason for a hurried departure! Of all
moderate endurances, I know of none to compare with a dinner at the
Tuileries. &ldquo;Stay!&mdash;halt!&rdquo; cries Memory; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you of one worse
again&mdash;a dinner at Neuilly!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The former is sure to include a certain number of distinguished and
remarkable men, who, even under the chill and restraint of a royal
entertainment, venture now and then on some few words that supply the void
where conversation should be. At Neuilly it is strictly a family party,
where, whatever ease may be felt by the illustrious hosts, the guests have
none of it. Juvenal quaintly asks, If that can be a battle where you
strike and I am beaten? so one is tempted to inquire, If that can be
called society where a royal personage talks rapidly for hours, and the
listener must not even look dissent? The King of the French is
unquestionably a great man, but not greater in any thing than in the
complete mystification in which he has succeeded in enveloping his real
character, mingling up together elements so strange, so incongruous, and
seemingly inconsistent, that the actual direction or object of any
political move he has ever made, will always bear a double appreciation.
The haughty monarch is the citizen king; the wily and secret politician,
the most free-spoken and candid of men: the most cautious in an intrigue,
the very rashest in action. How is it possible to divine the meaning, or
guess the wishes, of one whose nature seems so Protean?
</p>
<p>
His foreign policy is, however, the master-stroke of his genius,&mdash;the
cunning game by which he has conciliated the party of popular institutions
and beguiled the friends of absolutism, delighting Tom Buncombe and
winning praise from Nicholas. Like all clever men who are vain of their
cleverness, he has always been fond of employing agents of inferior
capacity, but of unquestionable devotion to his interests. What small
intelligences&mdash;to use a phrase more French than English&mdash;were
the greater number of the French ministers and secretaries I have met
accredited to foreign courts! I remember Talleyrand&rsquo;s observation, on the
remark being made, was, &ldquo;His Majesty always keeps the trumps in his own
hand.&rdquo; Though, to be sure, he himself was an evidence to the contrary&mdash;a
&ldquo;trump&rdquo; led boldly out, the first card played!
</p>
<p>
So well did that subtle politician comprehend the future turn events must
take, that on hearing, at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, that his Royal
Highness the Duc d&rsquo;Orléans had consented to assume the crown, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;And I am now ambassador at St. James&rsquo;s!&rdquo; It must have been
what the Londoners call &ldquo;good fun&rdquo; to have lived in the days of the
Empire, when all manner of rapid elevations occurred on every hand. The <i>commis</i>
of yesterday, the special envoy to-day; a week ago a corporal, and now
gazetted an officer, with the cross of the Legion&mdash;on the <i>grande
route</i>, to become a general. A General, why not a Marshal of France&mdash;ay,
or a King?
</p>
<p>
We have seen something of this kind in Belgium within a few years back&mdash;on
a small scale, it is true. What strange ingredients did the Revolution
throw up to the surface! what a mass of noisy, turbulent, self-opinionated
incapables, who, because they had led a rabble at the Porte de Flandre,
thought they could conduct the march of an army! And the statesmen!&mdash;good
lack! the miserable penny-a-liners of the &ldquo;Indépendant&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Lion
Beige,&rdquo; that admirable symbol of the land, who carries his tail between
his legs. The really able, and, I believe, honest men, were soon
overwhelmed by the influence of the priest party&mdash;the vultures who
watched the fight from afar, and at last descended to take all the spoils
of the victory.
</p>
<p>
Wandeweyer and Nothomb are both men of ability, the latter a kind of
Brummagen Thiers, with the same taste for intrigue, the same subtle
subserviency to the head of the state, and, in his heart, the same cordial
antipathy to England. But why dwell on these people? they will scarce
occupy a foot-note in the old &ldquo;Almanach.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The diplomatic history of our day, if it ever be written, will present no
very striking displays of high-reaching intellect or devoted patriotism;
the men who were even greatest before the world were really smallest
behind &ldquo;the fact.&rdquo; We deemed that Lord Aberdeen and Lord Palmerston, and
Messrs. Guizot and Thiers, and a few more, were either hurrying us on to
war or maintaining an admirable peace. But the whole thing resolves itself
into the work of one man and one mind; neither very conspicuous, but so
intently occupied, so devotedly persevering, that persistance has actually
elevated itself to genius; and falling happily upon times when mediocrity
is sublime, he has contrived to make his influence felt in every state of
Europe. I speak not of Louis Philippe, but of his son-in-law, King
Leopold.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me make the ballads of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws,&rdquo;
 said the great statesman; and in something of the same spirit his Majesty
of Belgium may have said, &ldquo;Let me make the royal marriages of Europe, and
any one who pleases may choose the ministry.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<i>Apropos</i> of the Roi Leopold, is it not difficult to understand a
Princess Charlotte falling in love with his good looks? There is no
disputing on this point. The most eminently successful man I ever knew in
ladies&rsquo; society was Jack Beauclerc&mdash;&ldquo;Caucasian Jack&rdquo; we used to call
him at Brookes&rsquo;s. Everybody knows Jack was no beauty. Heavy beetling
brows, a dark, saturnine, ill-omened expression, was ever on his features.
Nor did his face light up at times, as one occasionally sees with such
men; he was always the same sail misanthropic-looking fellow. Neither
could one call him agreeable&mdash;at least I, meeting him very often,
never found him so. But he was of a determined, resolute nature; one of
those men that appear never to turn from any object on which they have set
a strong will. This may have gone very far with ladies, who very often
conceive a kind of esteem for whatever they fear. He said himself that his
secret was, &ldquo;always using them ill;&rdquo; and certainly, if facts could bear
out such a theory, one might believe him. Probably no man ever cultivated
these tastes with such assiduity&mdash;these, I say, for play and duelling
were also passions with him.
</p>
<p>
He was <i>attaché</i> to our mission at Naples before he was sixteen, and
had the honour of wounding the old Marquis d&rsquo;Espagna with the small sword
at the same precocious era. The duel originated after a truly Italian
manner; and as there are at Naples many incorrect reports of it, I will
take the trouble to give the real one. The Marquis was an old man, married
to one of the most beautiful women in Italy. She was a Venetian, and if my
memory serves me right, a Guillardini by birth. She married him at
eighteen to escape a convent, he being the richest noble under the rank of
the blood royal at Naples. Very unlike the majority of Italian husbands,
the Marquis was excessively jealous, would not permit the most innocent
freedoms of his young and lovely wife, and eventually secluded himself and&mdash;worse
still&mdash;her from all society, and never appeared except at a court
ball, or some such festivity that there were no means of avoiding. It was
at one of these festivities that the King, who liked to see his ball-room
put forth its fairest aspect, bantered the Marquis on the rumour that had
even reached the ears of royalty, as to his inordinate jealousy. The
Marquis, whose old spirit of courtiership predominated even as strongly as
his jealousy, assured his Majesty that the worthy people of Naples did him
great injustice, and that, although conscious of the Marquesa&rsquo;s great
beauty and attractiveness, he had yet too high a sense of the
distinguished place he and his family had always held in the esteem of his
sovereign to feel jealous of any man&rsquo;s pretension; adding, &ldquo;If I have not
admitted the conventional addition of a <i>cavalière servente</i> to my
household, I would beg your Majesty to believe it is simply because I have
seen no one as yet worthy to hand la Mar-quesa to her carriage or fold her
shawl.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Admirably spoken, Marquis!&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;the sentiment is quite worthy
of one who has the best blood of Sicily in his veins. But remember what an
artificial state of society we live in; think of our conventional usages,
and what a shock it gives to public opinion when one, placed in so exalted
a position as you are, so palpably affronts universal and admitted custom;
recollect that your reserve involves a censure on others, less suspicious,
and, we would hope, not less rigidly honourable men, than yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But what would your Majesty counsel?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Select a <i>cavalière</i> yourself, as little likely to excite your
jealousy as you please; as little agreeable as possible, if you prefer it:
but, comply at least so far with the world&rsquo;s prescription, and do not
shock our worthy Neapolitans by appearing to reflect upon them. There,
what say you to that boy yonder? he is only a boy&mdash;he has just joined
the English mission here. I&rsquo;m sure he has formed no tender engagements to
prevent you adopting him, and you will at least seem to conform with the
usages of your neighbours.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If your Majesty commands&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay, Marquis, I but advise.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Majesty&rsquo;s wish is always a command. I feel proud to obey.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then, I am very happy to say I wish it,&rdquo; said the King, who turned away,
dying to tell the court-party how miserable he had made the old Marquis.
</p>
<p>
Such are <i>débauché</i> Kings; the glorious prerogative of power becomes
the mere agent of perverted ingenuity to work mischief and do wrong!
</p>
<p>
The poor Marquis lost no time to follow out the royal commands, and at
once made acquaintance with Beauclerc&mdash;only too happy to be noticed
in such a quarter. I know not whether the lady was much gratified by the
result of this kingly interposition in her favour: some said, Yes, and
that the youth was really gifted and <i>spirituel</i>, with a vein of
quiet, caustic humour, most amusing; others&mdash;and I half incline to
this notion&mdash;pronounced him dull and uninteresting. At all events,
the Marquesa enjoyed the liberty of appearing often in public, and seeing
more of the world than heretofore. She usually visited the San Carlos,
too, twice a week; a great improvement in her daily life, as previously
the Opera was denied her.
</p>
<p>
Immediately over the Marquesa&rsquo;s box was the large box, or rather <i>salon</i>,
belonging to the club of the Italian <i>nobili</i>, who frequented the
theatre far less for the pleasures of the opera and the ballet than for
the more exciting delights of <i>faro</i> and <i>écarté</i>; and here,
nightly, were assembled all the most dissipated and spendthrift youth of a
capital, whose very gravest and most exemplary citizens would be reckoned
&ldquo;light company&rdquo; any where else.
</p>
<p>
High play, with all its consequences of passionate outbreaks, ruin, and
duelling, were the pastimes of this ill-fated <i>loge</i>; and,
notwithstanding the attractions the box underneath contained, Jack
Beauclerc was far oftener in the second tier than the first. He was,
indeed, a most inveterate gambler; and the few moments which he devoted to
attending the Marquesa to her box, or her carriage, were so many instants
of pregnant impatience till he was back at the play-table.
</p>
<p>
It was on one evening, when, having lost a very heavy sum, that his turn
came to deal; and, with the superstitious feeling that only a play-man can
understand, he resolved to stake a very large amount upon the game. The
attention of the bystanders&mdash;never very deeply engaged by the <i>scène</i>&mdash;was
now entirely engrossed by the play-table, where Beauclerc and his
adversary were seated at <i>écarté</i>. It was that critical moment when
the cards were dealt, but the trump not yet turned, and Beauclerc sat
enjoying, with a gambler&rsquo;s &ldquo;malign&rdquo; delight, the eager anxiety in the
other player&rsquo;s countenance, when suddenly a voice said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ha, Beauclerc! the Marquesa is rising&mdash;she is about to leave the
theatre.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is only the second act.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is quite true, though,&rdquo; rejoined another; &ldquo;she is putting on her
mantle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind our party, then,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc&rsquo;s antagonist; &ldquo;I will hold
myself ready to play the match out whenever you please.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I please it now, then!&rdquo; said he, with a degree of energy that heavy
losses had, in spite of him, rendered uncontrollable.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Il Signor Beauclerc!&rdquo; said a servant, approaching, &ldquo;the Marquis d&rsquo;Espagna
desires to see you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell him I am engaged&mdash;I can&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, turning up the
trump-card, which he held out triumphantly before his adversary, saying,
&ldquo;The king!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At the same instant the old Marquis entered, and, approaching the table,
whispered a few words in his ear. If an adder had pierced him with its
sting, Beauclerc could not have started with a more agonised expression;
and he sprang from the chair and rushed out of the theatre, not by the
door, however, where the Marquesa&rsquo;s carriage was yet standing, but by a
private passage, which led more easily towards his lodgings.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is this piece of news, that all are so amused by?&rdquo; said the King,
the next morning, as he was rising.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your majesty alludes to the Marquis d&rsquo;Es-pagna, no doubt,&rdquo; said Count
Villafranca. &ldquo;He challenged the young English <i>attaché</i> last night,
at the theatre, and they have been out this morning; and, strange to say,
that the Marquis, the very best swordsman we have ever had here, was
disarmed and run through the side by his antagonist.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is the wound dangerous?&rdquo; said the King, coolly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe not, your Majesty. Beauclerc has behaved very well since it
happened; he has not left the Marquis for a moment, and has, they say,
asked pardon most humbly for his offence, which was, indeed, a very gross
neglect of the Marchesa no husband could pardon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I heard,&rdquo; said the King, yawning. &ldquo;The Marquis is very tiresome, and a
great bore: but, for all that, he is a man of spirit; and I am glad he has
shewn this young foreigner that Italian honour cannot be outraged with
impunity!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Such is the true version; and, let people smile as they like at the
theory, I can assure them it is no laughing matter. It is, doubtless,
somewhat strange to our northern ideas of domestic happiness that a
husband should feel called on to punish a want of sufficient attention to
his wife, from the man whom the world regards as her lover. We have our
own ideas on the subject; and, however sensitive we may feel on this
subject, I sincerely hope we shall never push punctilio so far as the
Neapolitans.
</p>
<p>
Such, without the slightest exaggeration, are the pictures Italy presents,
for more impressive on the minds of our travelling youth than all that
Correggio has touched or Raphael rendered immortal. Will their
contemplation injure us? Shall we become by habit more lenient to vice,
and less averse to its shame? or shall we, as some say, be only more
charitable to others, and less hypocritical ourselves? I sadly fear that,
in losing what many call &ldquo;our affected prudery,&rdquo; we lose the best
safeguard of virtue. It was, at the least, the &ldquo;livery of honour,&rdquo; and we
shewed ourselves not ashamed to wear it. And yet there are those who will
talk to you&mdash;ay, and talk courageously&mdash;of the domestic LIFE OP
ITALY!
</p>
<p>
The remark has been so often made, that by the mere force of repetition it
has become like an acknowledged truth, that, although strangers are rarely
admitted within its precincts, there exists in Italy and in Italian cities
a state of domestic enjoyment to which our boasted home-life in England
must yield the palm. Never was there any more absurd assertion less
propped by fact&mdash;never was the &ldquo;<i>ignotum</i>&rdquo; so easily taken &ldquo;<i>pro
beatifico</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The domestic life of England has no parallel in any part of Europe, save,
perhaps, in some of the French provinces, where the old &ldquo;<i>vie du château</i>&rdquo;
 presents something similar; but, even there, it rather lingers like the
spirit of a departed time, the relic of bygone associations, than in the
full reign of a strong national taste. In Germany, notwithstanding the
general impression to the contrary, there is still less of it: the passion
for household duties by the woman, the irresistible charms of beer and
tobacco to the men, suggest different paths; and while she indulges her
native fondness for cookery and counting napkins at home, he, in some
wine-garden, dreams away life in smoke-inspired visions of German
regeneration and German unity. In Italy, however, the points of contact
between the members of a family are still fewer again: the meal-times,
that summon around the board the various individuals of a house, are here
unknown; each rises when he pleases, and takes his cup of coffee or
chocolate in solitary independence&mdash;unseen, unknown, and, worse
still, unwashed!
</p>
<p>
The drawing-room, that paradise of English home-existence, has no place in
the life of Italy. The lady of the house is never seen of a morning; not
that the cares of family, the duties of a household, engross her&mdash;not
that she is busied with advancing the education of her children, or
improving her own. No: she is simply <i>en deshabille</i>. That is, to be
sure, a courteous expression for a toilet that has cost scarce five
minutes to accomplish, and would require more than the indulgence one
concedes to the enervation of climate to forgive.
</p>
<p>
The master of the family repairs to the café: his whole existence revolves
around certain little tables, with lemonade, sorbets, and dominoes; his
physical wants are, indeed, few, but his intellectual ones even fewer; he
cares little for politics&mdash;less for literature; his thoughts have but
one theme&mdash;intrigue; and his whole conversation is a sort of <i>chronique
scandaleuse</i> on the city he lives in.
</p>
<p>
There is a tone of seeming good-nature&mdash;an easy, mock charity, in the
way he treats his neighbours&rsquo; backslidings&mdash;that have often suggested
to strangers favourable impressions as to the kindliness of the people;
but this is as great an error as can be: the real explanation of the fact
is the levity of national feeling, and the little impression that breaches
of morality make upon a society dead to all the higher and better dictates
of virtue&mdash;such offences being not capital crimes, but mere
misdemeanours.
</p>
<p>
The dinner-hour occasionally, but not always, assembles the family to a
meal that in no respect resembles that in more civilised communities. The
periodical return of a certain set of forms&mdash;those <i>convenances</i>
which inspire, at the same time, regard for others and self-respect&mdash;the
admixture of courtesy with cordial enjoyment&mdash;have no representatives
around a board where the party assemble, some dusty and heated, others
wrapped up in dressing-gowns&mdash;all negligent, inattentive to each
other, and weary of themselves&mdash;tired of the long, unbroken morning,
which no occupation lightens, no care beguiles, no duty elevates. The
Siesta follows, evening draws near, and at last the life of Italy dawns&mdash;dawns
when the sun is setting! It is the hour of the theatre&mdash;the Theatre,
the sole great passion of the nation, the one rallying point for every
grade and class. Thither, now, all repair; and for a brief interval the
silent streets of the city bustle with the life and movement of the
inhabitants, as, on foot or in carriages, they hasten past.
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;business of the <i>scène</i>&rdquo; is the very least among the attractions
of a theatre in Italy. The opera-box is the drawing-room, the only one of
an Italian lady; it is the club-room of the men. Whist and faro, ombre and
piquet, dispute the interest with the <i>prima donna</i> or the <i>danseuse</i>
in one box; while in another the fair occupant turns from the ardent
devotion of stage-passion to listen to the not less impassioned, but as
unreal, protestation of her admirer beside her.
</p>
<p>
That the drama, as such, is not the attraction, it is sufficient to say
that the same piece is often played forty, fifty, sometimes seventy nights
in succession, and yet the boxes lose few, if any, of their occupants.
Night after night the same faces reappear, as regularly as the actors; the
same groupings are formed, the selfsame smiles go round; and were it not
that no trait of <i>ennui</i> is discernible, you would say that levity
had met its own punishment in the dreariness of monotony. These boxes
seldom pass out of the same family; from generation to generation they
descend with the family mansion, and are as much a part of the domestic
property of a house as the rooms of the residence. Furnished and lighted
up according to the taste and at the discretion of the owner, they present
to eyes only habituated to our theatres the strangest variety, and even
discordance, of aspect: some, brilliant in wax-light and gorgeous in
decoration, glitter with the jewelled dresses of the gay company; others,
mysteriously sombre, shew the shadowy outlines of an almost shrouded
group, dimly visible in the distance.
</p>
<p>
The theatre is the very spirit and essence of life in Italy. To the
merchant it is the Bourse; it is the club to the gambler, the <i>café</i>
to the lounger, the drawing-room and the boudoir to the lady. But where is
the domestic life?

<h2>
CHAPTER III.
</h2>
<p>
Another note from Favancourt, asking me to dine and meet Alfred de Vigny,
whose &ldquo;Cinque Mars&rdquo; I praised so highly. Be it so; I am curious to see a
Frenchman who has preferred the high esteem of the best critics of his
country, to the noisy popularity such men as Sue and Dumas write for.
</p>
<p>
De Vigny is a French Washington Irving, with more genius, higher taste,
but not that heartfelt appreciation of tranquil, peaceful life, that the
American possesses. As episode, his little&rsquo;tale, the &ldquo;Canne de Jonc,&rdquo; is
one of the most affecting I ever read. From the outset you feel that the
catastrophe must be sad, yet there is nothing harassing or wearying in the
suspense. The cloud of evil, not bigger than a man&rsquo;s hand at first,
spreads gradually till it spans the heavens from east to west, and night
falls solemn and dark, but without storm or hurricane.
</p>
<p>
I scarcely anticipate that such a writer can be a brilliant converser. The
best gauge I have ever found of an authors agreeability, is in the amount
of dialogue he throws into his books. Wherever narrative, pure narrative,
predominates, and the reflective tone prevails, the author will be,
perhaps necessarily, more disposed to silence. But he who writes dialogue
well, must be himself a talker. Take Scott, for instance; the very
character of his dialogue scenes was the type of his own social powers: a
strong and nervous common sense; a high chivalry, that brooked nothing low
or mean; a profound veneration for antiquity; an innate sense of the
humorous, ran through his manner in the world, as they display themselves
in his works.
</p>
<p>
See Sheridan, too, he talked the School for Scandal all his life; whereas
Goldsmith was a dull man in company. Taking this criterion, Alfred de
Vigny will be quiet, reserved, and thoughtful; pointed, perhaps, but not
brilliant. <i>Apropos</i> of this talking talent, what has become of it?
French <i>causerie</i>, of which one hears so much, was no more to be
compared to the racy flow of English table-talk, some forty years back,
than a group of artificial flowers is fit to compete with a bouquet of
richly scented dew-spangled buds, freshly plucked from the garden.
</p>
<p>
Lord Brougham is our best man now, the readiest&mdash;a great quality&mdash;and,
strange as it may sound to those who know him not, the best-natured, with
anecdote enough to point a moral, but no storyteller; using his wit as a
skilful cook does lemon-juice&mdash;to flavour but not to sour the <i>plat</i>.
</p>
<p>
Painters and anglers, I have remarked, are always silent, thoughtful men.
Of course I would not include under this judgment such as portrait and
miniature painters, who are about, as a class, the most tiresome and
loquacious twaddlers that our unhappy globe suffers under. Wilkie must
have been a real blessing to any man sentenced to sit for his picture: he
never asked questions, seldom indeed did he answer them; he had nothing of
that vulgar trick of calling up an expression in his sitter; provided the
man staid awake, he was able always to catch the traits of feature, and,
when he needed it, evoke the <i>prevailing</i> character of the
individual&rsquo;s expression by a chance word or two. Lawrence was really
agreeable&mdash;so, at least, I have always heard, for he was before my
day; but I suspect it was that officious agreeability of the artist, the
smartness that lies in wait for a smile or the sparkle of the eye, that he
may transmit it to the panel.
</p>
<p>
The great miniature painter of our day is really a specimen of a miniature
intelligence&mdash;the most incessant little driveller of worse than
nothings: the small gossip that is swept down the back-stairs of a palace,
the flat commonplaces of great people, are his stock-in-trade: the only
value of such contributions to history is, that they must be true. None
but kings could be so tiresome! I remember once sitting to this gentleman,
when only just recovering from an illness, and when possibly I endured his
forced and forty-horse power of small talk with less than ordinary
patience. He had painted nearly every crowned head in Europe&mdash;kings,
kaisers, archdukes, and grand-duchesses in every principality, from the
boundless tracts of the Czar&rsquo;s possessions, to those states which emulate
the small green turf deposited in a bird&rsquo;s cage. Dear me! how wearisome it
was to hear him recount the ordinary traits that marked the life of great
people, as if the greatest Tory of us all ever thought Kings and Queens
were anything but men and women!
</p>
<p>
I listened, as though in a long distressing dream, to narratives of how
the Prince de Joinville, so terribly eager to burn our dockyards and
destroy our marine, could be playful as a lamb in his nursery with the
children. How Louis Philippe held the little Count de Paris fast in his
chair till his portrait was taken. (Will he be able to seat him so
securely on the throne of France?) How the Emperor of Austria, with a
simplicity of a great mind and a very large head, always thought he could
sit behind the artist and watch the progress of his own picture! I
listened, I say, till my ears tingled and my head swam, and in that moment
there was not a &ldquo;bounty man&rdquo; from Kentucky or Ohio that held royalty more
cheaply than myself. Just at this very nick my servant came to whisper me,
that an agent for Messrs. Lorch, Rath; et Co., the wine-merchants of
Frankfort, had called, by my desire, to take an order for some hock.
Delighted at the interruption, I ordered he should be admitted, and the
next moment a very tall pretentious-looking German, with a tremendously
frogged and Brandenburged coat, and the most extensive beard and
moustaches, entered, and with all the ceremonial of his native land
saluted us both, three times over.
</p>
<p>
I received him with the most impressive and respectable politeness, and
seemed, at least, only to resume my seat after his expressed permission.
The artist, who understood nothing of German, watched all our proceedings
with a &ldquo;miniature eye,&rdquo; and at last whispered gently, &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; said I, in a low tone, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know?&mdash;he is the Crown
Prince of Hanover!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The words were not uttered when my little friend let fall his palette and
sprang off his chair, shocked at the very thought of his being seated in
such presence. The German turned towards him one of those profoundly
austere glances that only a foreign bagman or an American tragedian can
compass, and took no further notice of him.
</p>
<p>
The interview over, I accompanied him to the antechamber, and then took my
leave, to the horror of Sir C&mdash;&mdash;-, who asked me at least twenty
times, &ldquo;why I did not go down to the door?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, we are old friends,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I knew him at Gottingen a dozen years
ago, and we never stand on any ceremony together.&rdquo; My fiction, miserable
as it was, served me from further anecdotes of royalty, since what private
history of kings could astonish the man on such terms of familiarity with
the Crown Prince of Hanover?
</p>
<p>
Talking of Hanover, and <i>apropos</i> of &ldquo;humbugs,&rdquo; reminds me of a
circumstance that amused me at the time it occurred. Soon after the
present King of Hanover ascended the throne, the Orangemen of Ireland, who
had long been vain of their princely Grand Master, had sufficient
influence on the old corporation of Dublin to carry a motion that a
deputation should be despatched to Hanover, to convey to the foot of the
throne the sincere and respectful gratulations of the mayor, aldermen, and
livery of Dublin on the auspicious advent of his Majesty to the crown of
that kingdom. The debate was a warm one, but the majority which carried
the measure large; and, now, nothing remained but to name the happy
individuals who should form the deputation, and then ascertain in what
part of the globe Hanover lay, and how it should be come at.
</p>
<p>
Nothing but the cares of state and the important considerations of duty,
could prevent the mayor himself accepting this proud task: the sheriffs,
however, were free. Their office was a sinecure, and they accordingly were
appointed, with a sufficient suite, fully capable of representing to
advantage, abroad, the wealth, splendour, and intelligence of the &ldquo;ancient
and loyal corporation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
One of the sheriffs, and the chief member of the mission, was, if I
remember aright, a Mr. Timothy Brien; the name of the &ldquo;lesser bear&rdquo; I have
forgotten. Tim was, however, the spokesman, whenever speaking was
available; and when it was not, it was he that made the most significant
signs.
</p>
<p>
I was at the period a very young <i>attaché</i> of the mission at Hanover;
our secretary, Melmond, being <i>chargé d&rsquo;affaires</i> in the absence of
our chief, Melmond was confined to bed by a feverish attack, and the
duties of the mission, limited to signing a passport or two once a-month,
or some such form, were performed by me. Despatches were never sent. The
Foreign Office told us, if we had any thing to say, to wait for the
Russian courier passing through, but not to worry them about anything. I
therefore had an easy post, and enjoyed all the dignities of office
without its cares. If I had only had the pay, I could have asked nothing
better.
</p>
<p>
It was, then, of a fine morning in May that Count Beulwitz, the Minister
for Foreign Affairs, was announced, and the same moment entered my
apartment. I was, I own it, not a little fluttered and flattered by this
mark of recognition on the part of a minister, and resolved to play my
part as deputy assistant <i>chargé d&rsquo;affaires</i> to my very utmost.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I come, Mr. Templeton,&rdquo; said the minister, in a voice not quite free from
agitation, &ldquo;to ask your counsel on a question of considerable nicety; and
as Mr. Melmond is still unable to attend to duty, you must excuse me if I
ask you to bestow the very gravest attention upon the point.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I assumed the most Talleyrand of looks, and he went on.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This morning there has arrived here in four carriages, with great pomp
and state, a special mission, sent from Ireland to convey the
congratulations of the government on his Majesty&rsquo;s accession to the
throne. Now we have always believed and understood that Ireland was a part
of the British empire, living under the same monarchy and the same laws.
If so, how can this mission be accredited? It would be a very serious
thing for us to recognise the partition of the British empire, or the
separation of an integral portion, without due thought and consideration.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It would be also a very bold step to refuse the advances of a state that
deputes such a mission as this appears to be. Do your despatches from
England give any clue by which we may guide our steps in this difficulty?
have you heard latterly what are the exact relations existing between
England and Ireland? You are aware that his Majesty is at Berlin, and
Barring and Von der Decken, who know England so well, are both with him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I nodded assent, and, after a second&rsquo;s silence, a strong temptation to
quiz the Minister crossed my mind; and without even a guess at what this
mysterious deputation might mean, I gravely hinted that our last accounts
from Ireland were of the most serious nature. It was certainly true that
kingdom had been conquered by the English and subjected to the crown of
England, but there were the most well-founded reasons to fear that the
arrangement had not the element of a permanence. The descendant of the
ancient sovereigns of the land was a man of bold and energetic and
adventurous character; he was a prince of the house of O&rsquo;Connell, of
which, doubtless, his Excellency had heard. There was no saying what
events might have occurred to favour his ambitious views, and whether
England might not have found the advantage of restoring a troublesome land
to its ancient dynasty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How does the present mission present itself&mdash;how accredited?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;From the court of Dublin, with the great seal, so far as I can understand
the representation, for none of the embassy speak French.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That sounds very formal and regular,&rdquo; said I, with deep gravity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I think it, too,&rdquo; said his Excellency, who really was impressed by the
state-coach of Sheriff Timothy and three footmen in bag-wigs. &ldquo;At any
rate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we must decide at once, and there can be no hesitation
about the matter. I suppose we must give them an audience of the Crown
Prince, and then let all rest till his Majesty returns, which he will do
on Friday next.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Without compromising myself by any assent, I looked as if he had spoken
very wisely, and his Excellency departed.
</p>
<p>
That same afternoon two state-carriages of the court, with servants in
dress livery, drew up at the Hof von London, the hôtel where the
deputation had taken up their quarters, and a <i>Maréchal de Cour</i>
alighted to inform the &ldquo;Irish ambassador&rdquo; that his Royal Highness the
Crown Prince would receive their homage in the absence of the King. The
intimation, more conveyed by pantomime than oral intelligence, was replied
to by an equivalent telegraph; but the sheriffs, in all their gala, soon
took their places in the carriage and set out for the palace.
</p>
<p>
Their reception was most flattering; enough to say, they had the honour to
address and be replied to by one of the most courteous princes of Europe.
An invitation to dinner, the usual civility to a newly arrived mission,
ensued, and the Irish embassy, overwhelmed with the brilliant success of
their journey, returned to the hôtel in a state of exaltation that
bordered on ecstasy.
</p>
<p>
Their corporation address, formidable by its portentous parchment and
official seal, had puzzled the Foreign Office in no ordinary way, and was
actually under their weighty consideration the following day, when the
King most unexpectedly made his <i>entreé</i> into the capital. King
Ernest heard with some amazement, not unmingled by disbelief, that an
Irish diplomatic body had actually arrived at his court, and immediately
demanded to see their credentials. There is no need to recount the
terrible outbreak of temper which his Majesty displayed on discovering the
mistake of his ministers. The chances are, indeed, that, had he called
himself Pacha instead of King, he would have sentenced the Irish
ambassador and his whole following to be hanged like onions on the one
string. As it was, he could scarcely control his passion; and whatever the
triumphant pleasures of the day before, when a dinner-card for the palace
was conveyed by an aide-de-camp to the hotel, the &ldquo;second Epistle to
Timothy&rdquo; was a very awful contrast to its predecessor. The hapless
deputation, however, got leave to return unmolested, and betook themselves
to their homeward journey, the chief of the mission by no means so well
satisfied of his success in the part of the &ldquo;Irish Ambassador.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Now to dress for dinner. I wish I had said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this same invitation.
</p>
<p>
Nothing is pleasanter when one is in health and spirits than a <i>petit
diner</i>; nothing is more distressing when one is weak, low, and
dejected. At a large party there is always a means of lying <i>perdu</i>,
and neither taking any share in the cookery or the conversation. At a
small table one must eat, drink, and be merry, though the <i>plat</i> be
your doom and the talk be your destruction. There is no help for it; there
is no playing &ldquo;supernumerary&rdquo; in farce with four characters.
</p>
<p>
Is it yet too late to send an apology?&mdash;it still wants a quarter of
six, and six is the hour. I really cannot endure the fatigue and the
exhaustion.
</p>
<p>
Holland, besides, told me that any excitement would be prejudicial. Here
goes, then, for my excuse.... So! I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve done it. I feel myself
once more free to lie at ease on this ottoman and dream away the hours
undisturbed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Holloa! what&rsquo;s this, Legrelle?&rdquo; &ldquo;De la part de Madame la Comtesse, sir.
How provoking!&mdash;how monstrously provoking! She writes me, &lsquo;You really
must come. I will not order dinner till I see you.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c. B.
de F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo; What a bore! and what an absurd way to incur
an attack of illness! There&rsquo;s nothing for it, however, but submission; and
to-morrow, if I&rsquo;m able, I&rsquo;ll leave Paris.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Legrelle, don&rsquo;t forget to order horses for tomorrow at twelve.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What route does monsieur take?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Avignon&mdash;no, Strasbourg&mdash;Couilly, I think, is the first post. I
should like to see Munich once more, or, at least, its gallery. The city
is a poor thing, worthy of its people, and, I was going to say&mdash;no
matter what! Germany, in any case, for the summer, as I am sentenced to
die in Italy. I feel I am taking what the Irish call &lsquo;a long day&rsquo; in not
crossing the Alps till late in autumn!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
How many places there are which one has been near enough to have visited
and somehow always neglected to see! and what a longing, craving wish to
behold them comes over the heart at such a time as this? What, then, is
&ldquo;this time,&rdquo; that I speak it thus?
</p>
<hr />
<p>
How late it is! De Vigny was very agreeable, combining in his manner a
great deal of the refinement of a highly cultivated mind, with the shrewd
perception of a keen observer of the world. He is a <i>Légitimiste</i>, I
take it, without any hope of his party. This, after all, is the sad
political creed of all who adhere to the &ldquo;elder branch.&rdquo; Their devotion is
indeed great, for it wars against conviction. But where can an honest man
find footing in France nowadays? Has not Louis Philippe violated in
succession every pledge by which he had bound himself? Can such an example
of falsehood so highly placed be without its influence on the nation? Can
men cry &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; on the Minister, when they witness the turpitude of the
Monarch?
</p>
<p>
But what hope does any other party offer?&mdash;None. Henri Cinque, a
Bourbon of the <i>vieille roche</i>, gentle, soft-hearted, sensual, and
selfish, who, if he returned to France to-morrow, would never believe that
the long interval since the Three Days had been any thing but an accident;
and would not bring himself to credit the possibility that the succession
had been ever endangered.
</p>
<p>
I believe, after all, one should be as lenient in their judgment of men&rsquo;s
change of fealty in France as they are indulgent to the capricious fancies
of a spoiled beauty. The nation, like a coquette, had every thing its own
way. The cold austerities of principle had yielded to the changeful
fortunes of success for so many years, that men very naturally began to
feel that instability and uncertainty were the normal state of things, and
that to hold fast one set of opinions was like casting anchor in a stream
when we desired to be carried along by the current. Who are they who have
risen in France since the time of the Great Revolution? Are they the
consistent politicians, the men of one unvarying, unaltered faith? or are
they the expediency makers, the men of emergencies and crises, yielding,
as they would phrase it, to &ldquo;the enlightened temper of the times&rdquo;&mdash;the
Talleyrands, the Soults, the Guizots of the day?&mdash;not to speak of one
higher than them all, but not more conspicuous for his elevation than for
the subserviency that has placed him there.
</p>
<p>
Poor Chateaubriand! the man who never varied, the man that was humblest
before his rightful sovereign, and prouder than the proudest Marshal in
presence of the Emperor, how completely forgotten is he&mdash;standing
like some ruined sign-post to point the way over a road no longer
travelled! A more complete revolution was never worked in the social
condition of a great kingdom than has taken place in France since the time
of the Emperor. The glorious career of conquering armies had invested the
soldier&rsquo;s life with a species of chivalry, that brought back the old days
of feudalism again. Now, it is the <i>bourgeoisie</i> are uppermost. Trade
and money-getting, railroads and mines, have seized hold of the nation&rsquo;s
heart; and where the <i>bâton</i> of a Maréchal was once the most coveted
of all earthly distinctions, a good bargain on the Bourse, or a successful
transaction in scrip, are now the highest triumphs. The very telegraph,
whose giant limbs only swayed to speak of victories, now beckons to an
expectant crowd the rates of exchange from London to Livorno, and with a
far greater certainty of stirring the spirits it addresses.
</p>
<p>
I fell into all this moody reflection from thinking of an incident&mdash;I
might almost call it story&mdash;I remembered hearing from an old
cuirassier officer some years ago. I was passing through the north of
France, and stopped to dine at Sedan, where a French cavalry regiment,
three thousand strong, were quartered. Some repairs that were necessary to
my carriage detained me till the next day; and as I strolled along the
shady boulevards in the evening, I met an old soldier-like person, beside
whom I dined at the table-d&rsquo;hôte. He was the very type of a <i>chef-d&rsquo;escadron</i>
of the Empire, and such he really proved to be.
</p>
<p>
After a short preamble of the ordinary commonplaces, we began to talk of
the service in which he lived, and I confess it was with a feeling of
surprise I heard him say that the old soldiers of the Empire had met but
little favour from the new dynasty; and I could not help observing that
this was not the impression made upon us in England, but that we inclined
to think it was the especial policy of the present reign to conciliate the
affections of the nation by a graceful acknowledgment of those so
instrumental to its glory.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is not Soult as high, or rather, is he not far higher, in the favour of
his sovereign, Louis Philippe, than ever he was in that of the Emperor? Is
not Moncey a man nobly pensioned as Captain of the Invalides?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All true! But where are the hundreds&mdash;I had almost said thousands,
but that death has been so busy in these tranquil times with those it had
spared in more eventful days&mdash;where are they, the old soldiers, who
served in inferior grades, the men whose promotions for the hard fighting
at Montereau and Chalons needed but a few days more of prosperity to have
confirmed, but who saw their best hopes decline as the sun of the
Emperor&rsquo;s glory descended?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What rewards were given even to many of the more distinguished, but whose
principles were known to be little in accordance with the new order of
things? What of Pajol, who captured a Dutch fleet with his cavalry
squadrons;&mdash;ay! charged the three-deckers as they lay ice-locked in
the Scheldt, dismounted half of his force and boarded them, as in a
sea-fight? Poor Pajol! he died the other day, at eighty-three or four,
followed to the grave by the comrades he had fought and marched beside,
but with no honours to his memory from the King or his government. No,
sir, believe me, the present people never liked the Buonapartists; the sad
contrasts presented by all their attempts at military renown with those
glorious spectacles of the Empire were little flattering to them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then you evidently think Soult and some others owe their present favour,
less to the eminence of their services than to the plasticity of their
principles?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who ever thought Soult a great general?&rdquo; said he, abruptly answering my
question by this transition. &ldquo;A great military organizer, certainly&mdash;the
best head for the administration of an army, or the Emperor&rsquo;s staff&mdash;but
nothing more. His capacity as a tactician was always third rate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I could not help acknowledging that such was the opinion of our own great
captain, who has avowed that he regarded Massena as the most accomplished
and scientific general to whom he was ever opposed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Massena&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; cried the veteran indignantly, &ldquo;lives now in the
humblest poverty&mdash;the wife of a very poor man, who cultivates a
little garden near Brussels, where <i>femmes de chambre</i> are sent to
buy bouquets for their mistresses! The daughter of a <i>Maréchal de France</i>,
a title once that Kings loved to add to their royalty, as men love to
ennoble station by evidences of high personal desert!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How little fidelity, however, did these men shew to him who had made them
thus great! how numerous were the desertions!&mdash;how rapid too!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, there was an epidemic of treason at that time in France, just as you
have seen at different epochs, here, other epidemics prevail: in the
Revolution the passion was for the guillotine; then came the lust of
military glory&mdash;that suited us best, and lasted longest; we indulged
in it for twenty years: then succeeded that terrible revulsion, and men
hastened to prove how false-hearted they could be. Then came the
Restoration&mdash;and the passion was to be Catholic; and now we have
another order of things, whose worst feature is, that there is no
prevailing creed. Men live for the day and the hour. The King&rsquo;s health&mdash;the
state of Spain&mdash;a bad harvest&mdash;an awkward dispute between the
commander of our squadron in the Pacific with some of your admirals,&mdash;anything
may overturn the balance, and our whole political and social condition may
have to be built up once more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The great remedy against this uncertainty is out of your power,&rdquo; said I:
&ldquo;you abolished the claims of Sovereignty on the permanent affection of the
people, and now you begin to feel the want of &lsquo;Loyalty.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Our kings had ceased to merit the respect of the nation when they lost
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say, rather, you revenged upon them the faults and vices of their more
depraved, but bolder, ancestors. You made the timid Louis XVI. pay for the
hardy Louis XIV. Had that unhappy monarch but been like the Emperor, his
court might have displayed all the excesses of the regency twice told, and
you had never declared against them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That may be true; but you evidently do not&mdash;I doubt, indeed, if any
but a Frenchman and a soldier can&mdash;feel the nature of our attachment
to the Emperor. It was something in which personal interest partook a
large part, and the hope of future advancement, <i>through him</i>, bore
its share. The army regarded him thus, and never forgave him perfectly,
for preferring to be an Emperor rather than a General. Now, the very
desertions you have lately alluded to, would probably never have occurred
if the leader had not merged into the monarch.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There was a fascination, a spirit of infatuating ecstasy, in serving one
whose steps had so often led to glory, that filled a man&rsquo;s entire heart.
One learned to feel, that the rays of his own splendid achievements shed a
lustre on all around him and each had his portion of undying fame. This
feeling, as it became general, grew into a kind of superstition, and even
to a man&rsquo;s own conscience it served to excuse many grave errors, and some
direct breaches of true faith.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then, probably, you regard Ney&rsquo;s conduct in this light?&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it was of this nature,&rdquo; replied he, vehemently. &ldquo;Ney, like many
others, meant to be faithful to the Bourbons when he took the command. He
had no thought of treachery in his mind; he believed he was marching
against an enemy until he actually saw the Emperor, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I find this somewhat difficult to understand,&rdquo; said I, dubiously. &ldquo;Ney&rsquo;s
new allegiance was no hasty step, but one maturely and well considered. He
had weighed in his mind various eventualities, and doubtless among the
number the possibility of the Emperor&rsquo;s return. That the mere sight of
that low cocked-hat and the <i>redingote gris</i> could have at once
served to overturn a sworn fealty and a plighted word&mdash;-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you time to listen to a short story?&rdquo; interrupted the old dragoon,
with a degree of emotion in his manner that bespoke a deeper interest than
I suspected in the subject of our conversation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Will you come and sup with me at my hôtel, and we
can continue a theme in which I feel much interest?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay; with your permission, we will sit down here&mdash;on the ramparts. I
never sup: like an old campaigner, I only make one meal a-day, and mention
the circumstance to excuse my performance at the table d&rsquo;hôte: and here,
if you do not dislike it, we will take our places under this lime-tree.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I at once acceded to this proposal, and he began thus:&mdash;

<h2>
CHAPTER IV.
</h2>
<p>
You are, perhaps, aware, that in no part of France was the cause of the
exiled family sustained with more perseverance and courage than Auvergne.
The nobles, who, from generation to generation, had lived as seigneurs on
their estates, equally remote from the attractions and advantages of a
court, still preserved their devotion to the Bourbons as a part of
religious faith; nor ever did the evening mass of a château conclude
without its heartfelt prayer for the repose of that &ldquo;Saint Roi&rdquo; Louis
XVI., and for the blessing of heaven on him, his rightful successor, now a
wanderer and an exile.
</p>
<p>
In one of these antique châteaux, whose dilapidated battlements and
shattered walls shewed that other enemies than mere time had been employed
against it, lived an old Count de Vitry: so old was he, that he could
remember the time he had been a page at the court of Louis XV., and could
tell many strange tales of the Regency, and the characters who flourished
at that time.
</p>
<p>
His family consisted of two grandchildren, both of them orphans of his two
sons. One had fallen in La Vendée; the other, sentenced to banishment by
the Directory, had died on the passage out to Guadaloupe. The children
were nearly of the same age&mdash;the boy a few months older than the girl&mdash;and
regarded each other as brother and sister.
</p>
<p>
It is little to be wondered at if these children imbibed from the very
cradle a horror of that system and of those men which had left them
fatherless and almost friendless, destitute of rank, station, and fortune,
and a proportionate attachment to those who, if they had been suffered to
reign, would have preserved them in the enjoyment of all their
time-honoured privileges and possessions.
</p>
<p>
If the members of the executive government were then remembered among the
catalogue of persons accursed and to be hated, the names of the royal
family were repeated among those saintly personages to whom honour and
praise were rendered. The venerable Père Duclos, to whom their education
was confided, certainly neglected no available means of instilling these
two opposite principles of belief; and if Alfred de Vitry and Blanche were
not impressed with this truth, it could not be laid to the charge of this
single-hearted teacher; every trait and feature that could deform and
disgrace humanity being attributed to one, and all the graces and
ennobling virtues of the race associated with the name of the other. The
more striking and impressive to make the lesson, the Père was accustomed
to read a comment on the various events then occurring at Paris, and on
the campaigns of the Republican army in Italy; dwelling, with pardonable
condemnation, on the insults offered to the Church and all who adhered to
its holy cause.
</p>
<p>
These appeals were made with peculiar force to Alfred, who was destined
for an ecclesiastic, that being the only career which the old Count and
his chaplain could satisfy themselves as offering any hope of safety; and
now that the family possessions were all confiscated, and a mere remnant
of the estate remaining, there was no use in hoping to perpetuate a name
which must sink into poverty and obscurity. Blanche was also to become a
member of a religious order in Italy, if, happily, even in that sacred
land, the privileges of the Church were destined to escape.
</p>
<p>
The good Père, whose intentions were unalloyed by one thought unworthy of
an angel, made the mistake that great zeal not unfrequently commits&mdash;he
proved too much; he painted the Revolutionary party in colours so
terrible, that no possible reality could sustain the truth of the
portraiture. It is true, the early days of the Revolution warranted all he
did or could say; but the party had changed greatly since that, or,
rather, a new and a very differently minded class had succeeded. Marat,
Danton, and Robespierre had no resemblance with Sieyes, Carnot, and
Buonaparte. The simple-minded priest, however, recognised no distinction:
he thought that, as the stream issued from a tainted source, the current
could never become purer by flowing; and he delighted, with all the
enthusiasm of a <i>dévote</i>, to exaggerate the evil traits of those
whose exploits of heroism might have dazzled and fascinated unthinking
understandings.
</p>
<p>
Alfred was about sixteen, when one evening, nigh sunset, a peasant
approached the Château in eager haste to say that a party of soldiers were
coming up the little road which led towards the house, instead of turning
off, as they usually did, to the village of Puy de Dôme, half a league
further down the valley.
</p>
<p>
Père Duclos, who assumed absolute authority over the household since the
old Count had fallen into a state of childlike dotage, hastened to provide
himself with the writ of exemption from billet the Directory had conferred
on the château&mdash;an <i>amende</i> for the terrible misfortunes of the
ruined family&mdash;and advanced to meet the party, the leading files of
which were already in sight.
</p>
<p>
Nothing could less have suggested the lawless depredators of the Republic
than the little column that now drew near. Four chasseurs-à-pied led the
van, their clothes ragged and torn, their shoes actually in ribbons; one
had his arm in a sling, and another carried his shako on his back, as his
head was bound up in a handkerchief, whose blood-stained folds shewed the
marks of a severe sabre-cut. Behind them came a litter, or, rather, a cart
with a canvass awning, in which lay the wounded body of their officer; the
rear consisting of about fourteen others, under the command of a sergeant.
</p>
<p>
They halted and formed as the old Père approached them, and the sergeant,
stepping to the front, carried his hand to his cap in military salute; and
then, without waiting for the priest to speak, he began a very civil,
almost an humble, apology, for the liberty of their intrusion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an invalid party, <i>en route</i> for Paris, with an
officer who was severely wounded at the bridge of Lodi.&rdquo; And here he
lowered his voice to a whisper: &ldquo;The poor lieutenant&rsquo;s case being
hopeless, and his constant wish&mdash;his prayer,&mdash;being to see his
mother before he dies, we are pushing on for her Château, which is near
St. Jean de Luc, I hear.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Perhaps the mention of the word Château&mdash;the claim of one whose rank
was even thus vaguely hinted at&mdash;had nearly an equal influence on the
Père with the duties of humanity. Certain is it he laid less stress than
he might have done on the writ of exemption, and blandly said that the
out-offices of the Château should be at their disposal for the night;
apologising if late events had not left its inhabitants in better
circumstances to succour the unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We ask very little, Père,&rdquo; said the sergeant, respectfully&mdash;&ldquo;some
straw to sleep on, some rye-bread and a little water for supper; and
to-morrow, ere sunrise, you shall see the last of us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The humility of the request, rendered even more humble by the manner in
which it was conveyed, did not fail to strike the Père Duclos, who began
to wonder what reverses had overtaken the &ldquo;Blues&rdquo; (the name the
Republicans were called), that they were become thus civil and respectful;
nor could he be brought to believe the account the sergeant gave of a
glorious victory at the Ada, nor credit a syllable of the bulletin which,
in letters half-a-foot long, proclaimed the splendid achievement.
</p>
<p>
A little pavilion in the garden was devoted to the reception of the
wounded lieutenant, and the soldiers bivouacked in the farm-buildings, and
some even in the open air, for it was the vintage-time, and the weather
delightful. There was nothing of outrage or disturbance committed by the
men; not even any unusual noise disturbed the peaceful quiet of the old
Château; and, except that a lamp burned all night in the garden-pavilion,
nothing denoted the presence of strangers.
</p>
<p>
Before day broke the men were mustered in the court of the Château; and
the sergeant, having seen that his party were all regularly equipped for
the march, demanded to speak a few words to the Père Duclos. The Père, who
was from his window watching these signs of approaching departure with
some anxiety, hastily descended on hearing the request.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are about to march, reverend father,&rdquo; said the sergeant, saluting,
&ldquo;all of us, save one&mdash;our poor lieutenant; his next billet will be
for another, and, we hope, a better place.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; asked the Père, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not yet, father; but the event cannot now be far off. He raved all
through the night, and this morning the fever has left him, but without
strength, and evidently going fast. To take him along with us would be
inhuman, were it even possible&mdash;to delay would be against my orders;
so that nothing else is to be done than leave him among those who would be
kind to his last hours, and minister to the wants of a death-bed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Père, albeit very far from gratified by his charge, promised to do all
in his power; and the sergeant, having commanded a &ldquo;present arms&rdquo; to the
Château, wheeled right-about and departed.
</p>
<p>
For some days the prediction of the sergeant seemed to threaten its
accomplishment at every hour. The sick man, reduced to the very lowest
stage of debility, appeared at moments as if struggling for a last breath;
but by degrees these paroxysms grew less frequent and less violent: he
slept, too, at intervals, and awoke seemingly refreshed; and thus between
the benefits derived from tranquillity and rest, a mild and genial air,
and his own youth, his recovery became at length assured, accompanied,
however, by a degree of feebleness that made the least effort impossible,
and even the utterance of a few words a matter of great pain and
difficulty.
</p>
<p>
If, during the most sad and distressing periods of the sick bed, the Père
indirectly endeavoured to inspire Alfred&rsquo;s mind with a horror of a
soldier&rsquo;s life&mdash;depicting, by the force of the terrible example
before him, the wretchedness of one who fell a victim to its ambition&mdash;so
did he take especial care, as convalescence began to dawn, to forbid the
youth from ever approaching the pavilion, or holding any intercourse with
its occupant. That part of the garden was strictly interdicted to him, and
the very mention of the lieutenant at last forbidden, or only alluded to
when invoking a Christian blessing upon enemies.
</p>
<p>
In this way matters continued till the end of autumn, when the Père, who
had long been anxiously awaiting the hour when the sick man should take
his leave, had one morning set off for the town to make arrangements for
his departure, and order post-horses to be ready on the following day.
</p>
<p>
It was a calm and mellow day of autumn, and Alfred, who had at first
determined to set out on a fishing excursion, without any reason, changed
his mind, and sauntered into the garden. Loitering listlessly for some
time, from walk to walk, he was at length returning to the Château, when
he beheld, seated under the shade of a walnut-tree, a young man, whose
pale and languid look at once bespoke the invalid, even had not the fact
been proclaimed by his dress, the uniform of a <i>Lander rouge</i>.
</p>
<p>
Mindful of the Father&rsquo;s precept, and fully impressed with an obedience
never violated, the youth was turning hastily away, when the wounded man
slowly arose from his seat, and removing his cap, made a salute of deep
and most respectful meaning.
</p>
<p>
Alfred returned it, and stood irresolute. The eyes of the sick man, full
of an expression of mild and thankful beaming, were on him. What should he
do? to retire without speaking would be a rudeness, even a cruelty:
beside, what possible harm could there be in a few words of friendly
greeting with one so long their guest? Ere he could resolve the point, the
wounded officer was slowly advancing towards him, still uncovered, and in
an attitude betokening a most respectful gratitude.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I pray you will permit me, Mons. le Comte,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to express my
heartfelt thanks for the hospitality and kindness of your treatment. I
feared that I should leave this without the occasion of saying how
grateful I feel for the remnant of life your care has been the means of
preserving.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Alfred tried to answer: but a dread of his disobedience and its
consequences, and a strange sense of admiration for the stranger, whose
manner and appearance had deeply impressed him, made him silent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the lieutenant smiling, &ldquo;that you are indisposed to receive
an acknowledgment for what you set such small store by&mdash;a kindness to
a mere &lsquo;soldier of the Republic;&rsquo; but when you wear a sword yourself,
Mons. le Comte, as you will doubtless one of these days&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Alfred, hastily interrupting him, &ldquo;never! I shall never wear
one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How, never! What can you mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That I shall never be a soldier,&rdquo; said Alfred. &ldquo;I am to be a priest.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A priest! You, Mons. le Comte de Vitry, of the best blood of Auvergne&mdash;you,
a monk!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did not say a monk,&rdquo; said Alfred, proudly; &ldquo;there are other ranks among
churchmen. I have heard tell of Prince-bishops and Cardinals.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And if one were to begin life at the age they usually take leave of it,
such a career might not be held so cheaply; but for a young man of good
birth and blood, with a heart to feel proudly, and a hand to wield a
weapon&mdash;no, no, this were a shame not to be thought of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Stung alike by the severity of the sarcasm, and animated by the old spirit
of the Père&rsquo;s teaching, Alfred hastily answered:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And if men of rank and station no longer carry arms as their forefathers
did, with whom lies the blame? Why do they now bend to adopt a path that
in former days was only trodden by the weak-hearted and the timid? Because
they would not draw the sword in a cause they abhor, and for a faction
they despised; neither would they shed their blood to assure the triumph
of a rabble.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor would I,&rdquo; interposed the lieutenant, while a slight flush coloured
his cheek. &ldquo;The cause in which I perilled life was that of France, my
country. You may safely trust, that the nation capable of such conquests
will neither be disgraced by bad rulers, nor dishonoured by cowardly
ones.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no faith in Republicans,&rdquo; said Alfred, scornfully.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because they were not born to a title, perhaps! But do you know how many
of those who now carry victory into foreign lands belong to this same
class that includes all your sympathy?&mdash;prouder, far prouder, that
they sustain the honour of France against her enemies than that they carry
the blazon of a marquis or the coronet of a duke on their escutcheon? You
look incredulous! Nay, I speak no more than what I well know: for
instance, the humble lieutenant who now addresses you can claim rank as
high and ancient as your own. You have heard of the Liancourts?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Le Duc de Liancourt?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I am, or rather I was, the Duc de Liancourt,&rdquo; said the lieutenant,
with an almost imperceptible struggle: &ldquo;my present rank is Sous-Lieutenant
of the Third Lancers. Now listen to me calmly for a few moments, and I
hope to shew you, that in a country where a dreadful social earthquake has
uprooted every foundation of rank, and strewed the ground with the ruins
of every thing like prescription, it is nobler and better to shew that
nobility could enter the lists, unaided by its prestige, and win the palm,
among those who vainly boasted themselves better and braver. This we have
done, not by assuming the monk&rsquo;s cowl and the friar&rsquo;s cord, but by
carrying the knapsack and the musket; not by shirking the struggle, but by
confronting it. Where is the taunt now against the nobility of France?
whose names figure oftenest in the lists of killed and wounded? whose lot
is it most frequently to mount first to the assault or the breach? No, no,
take to the alb and the surplice if your vocation prompt it, but do not
assume to say that no other road is open to a Frenchman because his heart
is warmed by noble blood.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If Alfred was at first shocked by hearing assertions so opposed to all the
precepts of his venerated tutor, he was soon ashamed of offering
opposition to one so far more capable than himself of forming a just
judgment on the question, while he felt, inwardly, the inequality of the
cause for which he would do battle against&mdash;that glorious and
triumphant one of which the young officer assumed the championship.
</p>
<p>
Besides, De Liancourt&rsquo;s history was his own; he had been bred up with
convictions precisely like his, and might, had he followed out the path
intended for him, been a priest at the very hour that he led a charge at
Lodi.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was saved by an accident,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;In the march of Berthault&rsquo;s
division through Chalons, a little drummer-boy fell off a waggon when
asleep, and was wounded by a wheel passing over him: they brought him to
our château, where we nursed and tended him till he grew well. The Curé,
wishing to snatch him as a brand saved from the burning, adopted him, and
made him an acolyte; and so he remained till one Sunday morning, when the
‘Chasseurs gris&rsquo; marched through the town during mass. Pierre stole out to
see the soldiers; he heard a march he had often listened to before; he saw
the little drummers stepping out gaily in front; worse, too, <i>they</i>
saw him, and one called out to his comrades, &lsquo;Regarde donc le Prêtre; ce
petit drôle là&mdash;c&rsquo;est un Prêtre.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Du tout,&rsquo; cried he; tearing off his white robe, and throwing it behind
him, &lsquo;Je suis tambour comme toi,&rsquo; and snatching the drum, he beat his &lsquo;Ran
tap-plan&rsquo; so vigorously and so well, that the drum-major patted him on the
head and cheek, and away marched Pierre at the head of the troop, leaving
Chalons, and Curé, and all behind him, without a thought or a pang.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I saw it all from the window of the church; and suddenly, as my eyes
turned from the grand spectacle of the moving column, with its banners
flying and bayonets glistening, to the dim, half-lighted aisles of the old
church, with smoky tapers burning faintly, amid which an old decrepid
priest was moving slowly, a voice within me cried,&mdash;&lsquo;Better a <i>tambour</i>,
than this!&rsquo; I stole out, and reached the street just as the last files
were passing: I mingled with the crowd that followed, my heart beating
time to the quick march. I tracked them out of the town, further and
further, till we reached the wide open country.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you not come back, Pierre?&rsquo; said I, pulling him by the sleeve, as,
at last, I reached the leading files, where the little fellow marched,
proud as the tambour-major.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>I</i> go back, and the regiment marching against the enemy!&rsquo;
exclaimed he, indignantly; and a roar of laughter and applause from the
soldiers greeted his words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Nor I either!&rsquo; cried I. And thus I became a soldier, never to regret the
day I belted on the knapsack. But here comes the Père Duclos: I hope he
may not be displeased at your having kept me company. I know well he loves
not such companionship for his pupil&mdash;perhaps he has reason.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Alfred did not wait for the priest&rsquo;s arrival, but darted from the spot and
hastened to his room, where, bolting the door, he threw himself upon his
bed and wept bitterly. Who knows if these tears decided not all his path
in life?
</p>
<p>
That same evening the lieutenant left the château; and in about two months
after came a letter, expressing his gratitude for all the kindness of his
host, and withal a present of a gun and a chasseur&rsquo;s accoutrement for
Alfred.. They were very handsome and costly, and he was never weary of
trying them on his shoulder and looking how they became him; when, in
examining one of the pockets for the twentieth time, he discovered a
folded paper: he opened it, and found it was an appointment for a cadet in
the military school of St. Cyr. Alfred de Vitry was written in pencil
where the name should be inscribed, but very faintly, and so that it
required sharp looking to detect the letters. It was enough, however, for
him who read the words: he packed up a little parcel of clothes, and, with
a few francs in his pocket, he set out that night for Chalons, where he
took the <i>malle</i>. The third day, when he was tracked by the Père, he
was already enrolled a cadet, and not all the interest in France could
have removed him against his consent.
</p>
<p>
I will not dwell on a career which was in no respect different from that
of hundreds of others. Alfred joined the army in the second Italian
campaign&mdash;was part of Dessaix&rsquo;s division at Marengo&mdash;was wounded
at Aspern, and finally accompanied the Emperor in his terrible march to
Moscow. He saw more service than his promotion seemed to imply, however;
for, after Leipsig, Dresden, Bautzen, he was carried on a litter, with
some other dying comrades, into a little village of Alsace&mdash;a
lieutenant of hussars, nothing more.
</p>
<p>
An hospital, hastily constructed of planks, had been fitted up outside the
village&mdash;there were many such, on the road between Strasbourg and
Nancy; and here poor Alfred lay, with many more, their sad fate rendered
still sadder by the daily tidings, which told them that the cause for
which they had shed their blood was hourly becoming more hopeless.
</p>
<p>
The army that never knew defeat now counted nothing but disasters. Before
Alfred had recovered from his wound, the allies bivouacked in the Place
Carrousel, and Napoleon was at Elba!
</p>
<p>
When little dreaming that he could take any part in that general joy by
which France, in one of her least-thinking moments, welcomed back the
Bourbons, Alfred was loitering listlessly along one of the quays of Paris,
wondering within himself by what process of arithmetic he could multiply
seven sous&mdash;they were all he had&mdash;into the price of a supper and
a bed; and while his eyes often dwelt with lingering fondness on the
windows of the <i>restaurants</i>, they turned, too, with a dreadful
instinct towards the Seine, whose eddies had closed over many a sorrow and
crime.
</p>
<p>
As he wandered thus, a cry arose for help: an unfortunate creature&mdash;one
whose woes were greater, or whose courage to bear them less, than his own&mdash;had
thrown herself from the Pont-Neuf into the river, and her body was seen to
rise and sink several times in the current of the rapid stream, It was
from no prompting of humanity&mdash;it was something like a mere instinct,
and no more&mdash;mayhap, too, his recklessness of life had some share in
the act;&mdash;whatever the reason, he sprung into the river, and, after a
long and vigorous struggle, he brought her out alive; and then, forcing
through the crowd that welcomed him, he drew his miserable and dripping
hat over his eyes. He continued his road&mdash;Heaven knows he had little
purpose or object to warrant the persistence!
</p>
<p>
He had not gone far when a number of voices were heard behind him, calling
out,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is he!&mdash;there he is!&rdquo; and at the same instant an officer rode
up beside him, and, saluting him politely, said that her royal highness
the Duchess of Berri desired to speak to him;&mdash;her carriage was just
by.
</p>
<p>
Alfred was in that humour when, so indifferent is every object in life,
that he would have turned at the bidding of the humblest <i>gamin</i> of
the streets; and, wet and weary, he stood beside the door of the splendid
equipage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was <i>thou</i> that saved the woman?&rdquo; said the Duchess, addressing
him, and using the conventional &ldquo;Du,&rdquo; as suitable to his mean appearance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Alfred, removing his tattered hat, &ldquo;I am a gentleman! These
rags were once&mdash;the uniform of the Guard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My God!&mdash;my cousin!&rdquo; cried a voice beside the Duchess; and, at the
same instant, a young girl held out her hands towards him, and exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Knowest thou not me, Alfred? I am Alice&mdash;Alice de Vitry&mdash;thy
cousin and thy sister!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It would little interest you to dwell on the steps that followed, and
which, in a few weeks, made of a wretched outcast&mdash;without a home or
a meal&mdash;an officer of the <i>Guard du Corps</i>, with the order of
St. Louis at his breast.
</p>
<p>
Time sped on, and his promotion with it; and at length his Majesty,
graciously desiring to see the old nobility resume their place and grade,
consented to the union of Alfred with his cousin. There was no violent
love on either side, but there was sincere esteem and devoted friendship;
and if they neither of them felt that degree of attachment which becomes a
passion, they regarded each other with true affection.
</p>
<p>
Alice was a devoted Royalist: all that she had suffered for the cause had
endeared it to her; and she could forgive, but not forget, that her future
husband had shed his blood for the Usurper.
</p>
<p>
Alfred was what every one, and with reason, called a most fortunate
fellow: a colonel at twenty-eight&mdash;a promotion that, under the
Empire, nothing but the most distinguished services could have gained&mdash;and
yet he was far from happy. He remembered with higher enthusiasm his first
grade of &ldquo;corporal,&rdquo; won at Aspern, and his epaulettes that he gained at
Wilna. His soldiering had been learned in another school than in the
parade-ground at Versailles, or the avenue of the Champs Elysées.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, <i>mon ami!</i>&rdquo; said Alice, gaily, to him one morning, about ten
days before the time appointed for their marriage; &ldquo;thou art about to have
some occasion for thy long-rusting sword: the Usurper has landed at
Cannes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Emperor at Cannes!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Emperor, if thou wilt&mdash;but without an Empire.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No matter. Is he without an army?&rdquo; said Alfred.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Alone&mdash;with some half-dozen followers, at most. Ney has received
orders to march against him, and thou art to command a brigade.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is good news!&rdquo; said Alfred; for the very name of war had set his
heart a-throbbing; and as he issued forth into the streets, the stirring
sounds of excitement and rapid motion of troops increased his ardour.
</p>
<p>
Wondering groups were gathered in every street, some, discussing the
intelligence, others, reading the great placards, which, in letters of
portentous size, announced that &ldquo;the Monster&rdquo; had once more polluted by
his presence the soil of France.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the enthusiasm of the old Royalists to the Bourbon cause, there
seemed an activity and determination on the part of the Buonapartists who
had taken service with the King to exhibit their loyalty to the new
sovereign; and Ney rode from one quarter of Paris to the other, with a
cockade of most conspicuous size, followed by a staff equally remarkable.
</p>
<p>
That same day Alfred left Paris for Lyons, where his regiment lay, with
orders to move to the south, by forced marches, and arrest the advance of
the small party which formed the band of the invader. It was Alice herself
fastened the knot of white ribbon in his shako, and bade him adieu with a
fondness of affection he had never witnessed before.
</p>
<p>
From Paris to Lyons, and to Grenoble, Alfred hastened with promptitude. At
Lesseim, at last, he halted for orders.
</p>
<p>
His position was a small village, three leagues in advance of Lesseim,
called Dulaure, where, at nightfall on the 18th of March, Alfred arrived
with two companies of his regiment, his orders being to reconnoitre the
valley towards Lesseim, and report if the enemy should present himself in
that quarter.
</p>
<p>
After an anxious night on the alert, Alfred lay down to sleep towards
morning, when he was awoke by the sharp report of a musket, followed
immediately after by the roll of the drum and the call for the guard to
&ldquo;turn out.&rdquo; He rushed out, and hastened towards the advanced picket. All
was in confusion: some were in retreat; others stood at a distance from
their post, looking intently towards it; and at the picket itself were
others, again, with piled arms, standing in a close group. What could this
mean? Alfred called out, but no answer was returned. The men stared in
stupid amazement, and each seemed waiting for the other to reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where is your officer?&rdquo; cried De Vitry, in an angry voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is here!&rdquo; said a pale, calm-featured man, who, buttoned up in a grey
surtout, and with a low <i>chapeau</i> on his head, advanced towards him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You the officer!&rdquo; replied Alfred, angrily: &ldquo;you are not of our regiment,
sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon me, Colonel,&rdquo; rejoined the other; &ldquo;I led the twenty-second at
Rovigo, and they were with me at Wagram.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Grand Dieu!</i>&rdquo; said Alfred, trembling; &ldquo;who are you, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Emperor, Colonel de Vitry!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Alfred stepped back at the words. The order to arrest and make him
prisoner was almost on his lips. He turned towards his men, who
instinctively had resumed their formation; his head was maddened by the
conflict within it; his eyes turned again towards Napoleon&mdash;the
struggle was over-he knelt and presented his sword.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take mine in exchange, <i>General</i> de Vitry,&rdquo; said the Emperor; &ldquo;I
know you will wear it with honour.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And thus, in a moment, was all forgotten&mdash;plighted love and sworn
faith&mdash;for who could resist the Emperor?
</p>
<p>
The story is now soon told. Waterloo came, and once more the day of defeat
descended, never to dawn upon another victory. Alfred, rejected and
scorned, lived years in poverty and obscurity. When the fortunes of the
Revolution brought up once more the old soldiers of the Empire, he fought
at the Quai Voltaire and was wounded severely. The Three Days over, he was
appointed to a sous-lieutenancy in the dragoons. He is now <i>chef-d&rsquo;escadron</i>,
the last of his race, weary of a world whose vicissitudes have crushed his
hopes and made him broken-hearted.
</p>
<p>
The relator of this tale was Alfred de Vitry himself, who, under the name
of his maternal grandfather, St. Amand, served in the second regiment of
Carabiniers.

<h2>
CHAPTER V.
</h2>
<h3>
12 o&rsquo;clock, Tuesday night, May 31st, 184-.
</h3>
<p>
&ldquo;Que bella cosa&rdquo; to be a king! Here am I now, returned from Neuilly,
whither I dreaded so much to venture, actually enchanted with the
admirable manner of his Majesty Louis Philippe, adding one more to the
long list of those who, beginning with Madame de Genlis and Johnson, have
delighted to extol the qualities whose pleasing properties have been
expended on themselves.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, something wonderfully interesting in the picture of a
royal family living <i>en bourgeois</i>&mdash;a King sitting with his
spectacles on his forehead and his newspaper on his knee, playfully
alluding to observations whose fallacy he alone can demonstrate; a Queen
busily engaged amid the toils of the work-table, around which Princesses
of every European royalty are seated, gaily chatting over their
embroidery, or listening while an amusing book is read out by a husband or
a brother: even an American would be struck by such a view of monarchy.
</p>
<p>
The Duc de Nemours is the least prepossessing of the princes; his
deafness, too, assists the impression of his coldness and austerity: while
the too-studied courtesy of the Prince de Joinville towards Englishmen is
the reverse of an amicable demonstration.
</p>
<p>
I could not help feeling surprised at the freedom with which his Majesty
canvassed our leading political characters; for his intimate acquaintance
with them all, I was well prepared. One remark he made worth remembering,&mdash;&ldquo;The
Duke of Wellington should always be your Minister of Foreign Affairs, no
matter what the changes of party. It is not that his great opportunities
of knowing the Continent, assisted by his unquestionable ability, alone
distinguish him, but that his name and the weight of his opinion on any
disputed question exert a greater influence than any other man&rsquo;s over the
various sovereignties of Europe. After the Emperor himself, he was the
greatest actor in the grand drama of the early part of the century; he
made himself conspicuous in every council, even less by the accuracy of
his views than by their unerring, unswerving rectitude. The desperate
struggle in which he had taken part had left no traces of ungenerous
feeling or animosity behind, and the pride of conquest had never disturbed
the equanimity of the negotiator.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
What other statesman in England had dared to ratify the Belgian
revolution, and, by his simple acknowledgment, place the fact beyond
appeal? It is with statesmen as with soldiers; the men who have been
conversant with great events maintain the prestige of their ascendancy
over all who &ldquo;never smelt powder;&rdquo; and Metternich wields much of his great
influence on such a tenure.
</p>
<p>
<i>Apropos</i> of Metternich; the King told a trait of him which I have
not heard before. In one of those many stormy interviews which took place
between him and the Emperor, Napoleon, irritated at the tone of freedom
assumed by the Austrian envoy, endeavoured by an artifice to recall him to
what he deemed a recollection of their relative stations, and then, as it
were, inadvertently let fall his hat for the Prince to take it up; instead
of which Metternich moved back and bowed, leaving the Emperor to lift it
from the ground himself.
</p>
<p>
Napoleon, it would seem, was ever on the watch to detect and punish the
slightest infraction of that respect which &ldquo;doth hedge a king,&rdquo; even in
cases when the offender had nothing further from his mind than the
intention to transgress: a rather absurd illustration was mentioned by the
King. The Emperor was one day seeking for a book in the library at
Malmaison, and at last discovered it on a shelf somewhat above his reach.
Marshal Moocey, one of the tallest men in the army, who was present,
immediately stepped forward, saying, &ldquo;Permettez, Sire. Je suis plus grand
que votre Majesté!&rdquo; &ldquo;Vous voulez dire plus long, Maréchal,&rdquo; said the
Emperor, with a frown that made the reproof actually a severity.
</p>
<p>
From the tone of his Majesty&rsquo;s observations on our nobility, and the
security such an order necessarily creates, I thought I could mark a
degree of regret at the extinction of the class in France. How natural
such a feeling! For how, after all, can a monarchy long subsist with such
a long interval between the crown and the people? The gradations of rank
are the best guarantees against any assault on its privileges; a House of
Lords is the best floating breakwater against the storms of a people in
revolt.
</p>
<p>
With a marked condescension, his Majesty inquired after my health and the
object of my journey; and when I mentioned Naples, hastily remarked, &ldquo;Ah,
well! I can promise you a very agreeable house to pass your evenings in:
we are going to send Favancourt there as envoy, and Madame la Comtesse is
your countrywoman. This, however, is a secret which even Favancourt
himself is ignorant of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I am not casuist enough to say if this intimation of the King is binding
on me as to secrecy; but, possibly, I need not risk the point, as I shall
not be likely to see Favancourt or Madame de Favancourt before I start
to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
I am already impatient for the hour to go; I want to be away&mdash;afar&mdash;from
the gorgeous glitter of this splendid capital. Something nigh to
misanthropy creeps over me at the sight of pleasures in which I am no more
to take a part, and I would not that a feeling thus ungenerous should be
my travelling companion. I do not experience the inordinate love of life
which, we are told, ever accompanies my malady. If I have a wish to live,
it is to frame a different kind of existence from what I have hitherto
followed, and I believe most sick people&rsquo;s love of life is the desire of
dwelling longer amid the pursuits they have followed. And now for the map,
to see how I may trace a route, and see&mdash;shame that I must say so!&mdash;fewest
of my countrymen. Well, then, from Strasbourg to Fribourg, and through the
Hohlen-Thal.
</p>
<p>
So far, so good! This is all new to me. Thence to Munich, or direct to
Inspruck, as I may decide later on. This, at least, avoids Switzerland,
and all its radicalism and roguery, not to speak of the &ldquo;Perkinses,&rdquo; who
are &ldquo;out&rdquo; by this time, touring it to Lausanne and Chamouni.
</p>
<p>
What a tremendous noise a carriage makes coming through these <i>portes-cochères!</i>
Truly, the luxury is heavily paid for by all the inhabitants of a house.
Is that a tap at my door?
</p>
<hr />
<p>
A few lines before I lie down to sleep! It is already daybreak. What would
poor Dr. S&mdash;&mdash; say if he knew I had been sitting up to this
hour, and at a <i>petit souper</i> too, with some half-dozen of the
wealthiest people in Paris, not to speak of the prettiest? Madame de F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
would take no refusal, however, and averred she had made the party
expressly for me; that V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; had
declined another engagement to come; and, in fact&mdash;no matter what
little flatteries&mdash;I went; and here I am, with my cheek flushed and
my head on fire, my brain whirling with mad excitement, laughter still
ringing in my ears, and all the exaltation he feels who, drinking water
while others sip champagne, is yet the only one whose faculties are
intoxicated.
</p>
<p>
What a brilliant scene in a comedy would that little supper have been,
just as it really was; scenery, decorations, people all unchanged! the
dimly lighted boudoir, where all the luxury of modern requirement was seen
through a chiaroscuro, that made it seem half unreal; and then, the
splendid brilliancy of the supper-room beyond, where, amid the gorgeous
dis-play of <i>vaisselle</i> and flowers, shone still more brightly the
blaze of beauty and the fire of genius.
</p>
<p>
How often have I remarked in these little &ldquo;jousts of the table,&rdquo; where
each man puts forth his sharpest weapons of wit and pleasantry, that the
conqueror, like an Ivanhoe, is an unknown knight, and with a blank shield.
</p>
<p>
So was it, I remember once, where we had a sprinkling of every class of
celebrity, from the Chamber of Deputies to the Théâtre Français; and yet
the heart of all was taken by a young Spaniard, whom nobody seemed to know
whence or how he came,&mdash;a handsome, dark-eyed fellow, with a short
upper lip that seemed alive with energy, combining in his nature the stern
dignity of the Castilian and the hot blood of Andalusia. It was the
Marquis de Brabançon brought him, presenting him to the lady of the house
in a half whisper.
</p>
<p>
There are men it would be utter ruin to place in positions of staid and
tranquil respectability, and yet who make great names. They are born to be
adventurers. I remained the last, on purpose to hear who he was, feeling
no common curiosity, even though&mdash;as so often happens&mdash;the name,
when heard, conveys nothing to the ear, and leaves as little for the
memory.
</p>
<p>
I could not avoid remarking that he bore, in the mild and thoughtful
character of his brow, a strong resemblance to the portraits of
Claverhouse.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Alike in more than looks,&rdquo; said the hostess: &ldquo;they have many traits in
common, and shew that the proud Dundee was no exceptional instance of
humanity, uniting the softness of a girl with a courage even verging upon
ferocity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The stranger was the Spanish General Cabrebra!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now that you have seen him, let me tell you a short anecdote of him,
only worth remembering as so admirably in colouring with his appearance on
entering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Last year, at the head of a division of the army, the Bishop of Grenada,
accompanied by all his clergy, received him in a grand procession, and
safely escorted him to the episcopal palace, where a splendid collation
was prepared. The soldierlike air and manly beauty of the young General
were even less the theme of admiration than his respectful reception of
the Bishop, to whom he knelt in devout reverence, and kissed the hand with
deep humility, walking at his side with an air of almost bashful
deference.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At table, too, his manner was even more marked by respect. As the meal
proceeded, the Bishop could not fail remarking that his guest seemed
deeply possessed by some secret care, which made him frequently sigh, in a
manner betokening heavy affliction. After some pressing, it came out; the
source of the grief was, the inability of the General to pay his troops,
for the military chest was quite empty, and daily desertions were
occurring. The sum required was a large one, 20,000 contos, and the
venerable Bishop hastened to assure him, with unfeigned sorrow, that the
poor and suffering city could not command one-fourth of the amount.
Cabrebra rose, and paced the room in great excitement, ever throwing, as
he passed, a glance into the court-yard, where a party of grenadiers stood
under arms, and then, resuming his place at the table, he seemed
endeavouring, but vainly, to join in the festivity around him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It is evident to me, my son,&rsquo; said the Bishop, &lsquo;that some heavier sorrow
is lying at your heart; tell it, and let me, if it may be, give you
comfort and support.&rsquo; Cabrebra hesitated; and at last avowed that such was
the case. Considerable entreaty, however, was necessary to wring the
mystery from him: when at last he said, in a voice broken and agitated,
‘You know me, Holy Father, for a good and faithful son of the Church&mdash;for
one who reveres its ordinances, and those who dispense them» Think, then,
of my deep misery when&mdash;&mdash; but I cannot&mdash;I am utterly
unable to proceed.&rsquo; After much pressing he resumed, with sudden energy&mdash;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;I
know I shall never feel peace and happiness more, for although I have done
many a hard and cruel deed, I never, till now, had the dreadful duty to
order a Bishop to be shot! This is what is breaking my heart&mdash;this is
my secret misery.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is scarcely necessary to say, that he was speedily recovered from so
dreadful an embarrassment, for the Bishop was too good a Christian to see
a devout soldier reduced to such extremity. The money was paid, and the
Bishop ransomed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Our celebrity of to-night was of less mark&mdash;indeed, nominally, of
none&mdash;but he has but to escape &ldquo;rope and gun.&rdquo; and he will make a
name for himself.
</p>
<p>
He is a young Frenchman, one who, beginning at the lowest rung of the
ladder, may still climb high. Strange paths are open to eminence nowadays,
and there is no reason why a man may not begin life as a &ldquo;Vaudevilliste,&rdquo;
 and end it &ldquo;Pair de France.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Jules de Russigny&mdash;whence the &ldquo;de&rdquo; came from we must not inquire&mdash;like
most of the smart men of the day, is a Provençal; he was educated at a <i>Séminaire</i>,
and destined for the priesthood. Some slight irregularity caused his
dismissal, and he came to Paris on foot to seek his fortune. When toiling
up a steep ascent of the road at St Maurice, he saw before him on the way
a heavily laden travelling carriage, which, with the aid of his struggling
post-horses, was also labouring up the hill; an elderly gentleman had
descended to walk, and was plodding wearily after his lumbering equipage.
As Jules reached the crest of the ridge, all were gone, and nothing but a
deep column of dust announced the course of the departed carriage: at his
feet, however, he discovered a paper, which, closely written, and, by its
numerous corrections, appeared as closely studied, must have fallen from
the pocket of the traveller.
</p>
<p>
Jules sat down to inspect it, and found to his surprise it was a species
of memorandum on the subject of the educationary establishments of France,
with much statistic detail, and a great amount of information, evidently
the result of considerable labour and research. There were many points, of
course, perfectly new to him, but there were others with which he was well
acquainted, and some on which he was so well informed as to be able to
detect mistakes and fallacies in the memorandum. Conning the theme over,
he reached a little way-side inn, and inquiring who the traveller was that
passed, he heard, to his surprise, it was the Minister of Public
Instruction.
</p>
<p>
When Jules reached Paris, it was about a fortnight before the opening of
the Chambers, and the newspapers were all in full cry discussing the
various systems of education, and with every variety of opinion
pronouncing for and against the supposed views of the Government. Most
men, in his situation, would have sought out the Minister&rsquo;s residence,
and, restoring to him the lost paper, retired well satisfied with a very
modest recompense for a service that cost so little.
</p>
<p>
Not so Jules; he established himself in a cheap corner of the Pays Latin,
and spent his days conning over the various journals of Paris, until, by
dint of acute study and penetration, he had possessed himself of every
shade and hue of political opinion professed by each. At last he
discovered that the &ldquo;Siècle&rdquo; was the most decidedly obnoxious to the
Government, and the &ldquo;Moniteur&rdquo; most favourable to the newly projected
system. To each he sent an article: in one, setting forth a dim, but
suggestive idea, of what the Minister might possibly attempt, with a
terrific denunciation annexed to it; in the other, a half defence of the
plan, supported by statistic detail, and based on the information of the
manuscript.
</p>
<p>
These two papers both appeared, as assertion and rejoinder; and so did the
polemic continue for above a week, increasing each day in interest, and
gradually swelling in the number of the facts adduced, and the reasons for
which the opinion was entertained. Considerable interest was created to
know the writer, but although he was then dining each day, and that his
only meal, for four sous in the &ldquo;Ilee St. Louis,&rdquo; he preserved his <i>incognito</i>
unbroken, and never divulged to any one his secret. At last came an
announcement in the &ldquo;Siècle,&rdquo; at the close of one of the articles, that on
the next day would appear a full disclosure of the whole government
measure, with the mechanism by which its views were to be strengthened,
and the whole plan of conception on which it was based. That same evening
a young man, pale, and sickly looking, stood at the <i>porte-cochere</i>
of a splendid mansion in the Rue St. George, and asked to see the owner.
The rude repulse of the porter did not abash him, nor did the insolent
glance bestowed on his ragged shoes and threadbare coat cost him a pang of
displeasure: he felt that he could bide his time, for it would come at
last.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;His Excellency is at the Council!&rdquo; at last said the porter, somewhat
moved by a pertinacity that had nothing of rudeness in it.
</p>
<p>
With a calm resolve he sat down on a stone bench, and fell a-thinking to
himself. It was full three hours later when the Minister&rsquo;s carriage rolled
in, and the Minister, hastily descending, proceeded to mount the stairs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;One word, your Excellency,&rdquo; cried Jules, in a voice collected and firm,
but still of an almost imploring sound.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not now&mdash;at another time,&rdquo; said the Minister, as he took some papers
from his secretary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But one word, Sir&mdash;I crave no more,&rdquo; repeated Jules.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;See to that man, Delpierre,&rdquo; said the Minister to his secretary; but
Jules, passing hastily forward, came close to the Minister, and whispered
in his ear, &ldquo;<i>M. le Ministre, je suis Octave</i>,&rdquo; the name under which
the &ldquo;Siècle&rdquo; articles appeared. A few words followed, and Jules was
ordered to follow the Minister to his cabinet. The article of the &ldquo;Siècle&rdquo;
 did appear the next day, but miserably inefficient in point of ability;
and so false in fact-, that the refutation was overwhelming. The
&ldquo;Moniteur&rdquo; had a complete triumph, only to be exceeded by that of the
Minister&rsquo;s own in the Chamber. The Council of Ministers was in ecstasy,
and Jules de Russigny, who arrived in Paris by the mail from Orleans&mdash;for
thither he was despatched, to make a more suitable entry into the great
world&mdash;was installed as a clerk in the office of the Finance
Minister, with very reasonable hopes of future advancement. Such was the
fortune of him who was one, and, I repeat it, the pleasantest of our <i>convives</i>.
</p>
<p>
This is the age of smart men&mdash;not of high intelligences. The race is
not for the thoroughbred, but the clever hackney, always &ldquo;ready for his
work,&rdquo; and if seldom pre-eminent, never a dead failure.
</p>
<p>
Of my own brief experience, all the first-rate men, without exception,
have broke down. All the moderates&mdash;the &ldquo;clever fellows&rdquo;&mdash;have
carried the day. Now I could pick out from my contemporaries, at school
and university, some half-dozen brilliant, really great capacities, quite
lost&mdash;some, shipwrecked on the first venture in life&mdash;some,
disheartened and disgusted, have retired early from the contest, to live
unheard of and die brokenhearted. But the smart men! What crowds of them
come before my mind in high employ&mdash;some at home, some abroad, some
waxing rich by tens of thousands, some running high up the ambitious road
of honours and titles! There is something in inordinate self-esteem that
buoys up this kind of man. It is the only enthusiasm he is capable of
feeling&mdash;-but it serves as well as the &ldquo;real article.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
For the mere adventurer, the man of ready wit and a fearless temperament,
politics offer the best road to fortune. The abilities that would have
secured a mere mediocrity of position in some profession will here win
their way upwards. The desultory character of reading and acquirements, so
fatal to men chained to a single pursuit, is eminently favourable to him
who must talk about every thing, with, at least, the appearance of
knowledge; while the very scantiness of his store suggests a recklessness
that has great success in the world.
</p>
<p>
In England we have but one high road to eminence&mdash;Parliament.
Literature, whose rewards are so great in France, with us only leads to
intimacy with the &ldquo;Trade&rdquo; and a name in &ldquo;the Row.&rdquo; It is true,
Parliamentary reputation is of slow growth, and dependent on many
circumstances totally remote from the capacity and attainments of him who
seeks it. Are you the son of a great name in the Lords, the representative
of an immense estate, or of great commercial wealth? are you high in the
esteem of Corn men or Cotton men? are you a magnate of Railroads, or is
your word law in the City? then your way is open and your path easy.
Without these, or some one of them, you must be a segment of some leading
man&rsquo;s party&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
My own little experience of Parliament&mdash;about the very briefest any
man can recall&mdash;presents little pleasurable in the retrospect. Lord
Collyton was one of my Christchurch acquaintances, and at his invitation I
spent the autumn of 18&mdash; at his father, the Duke of Wrexington&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
The house was full of company, and, like an English house in such
circumstances, the most delightful <i>séjour</i> imaginable. Every second
day or so brought a relay of new arrivals, either from town or some other
country-house full of the small-talk of the last visit,&mdash;all that
strange but most amusing farrago which we designate by the humble title of
&ldquo;gossip,&rdquo; but which, so far as I can judge, is worth ten thousand times
more than the boasted <i>causerie</i> of France, and the perpetual effort
at smartness so much aimed at by our polite neighbours.
</p>
<p>
The guests were numerous, and presented specimens of almost every
peculiarity observable in Englishmen of a certain class. We had great
lords and high court functionaries, deep in the mysteries of Buckingham
House and Windsor; a sprinkling of distinguished foreigners; ministers,
and secretaries of embassy; some parliamentary leaders, men great on the
Treasury benches or strong on the Opposition. Beauties there were too,
past, present, and some, coming; a fair share of the notorieties of
fashion, and the last winner of the Derby, with&mdash;let me not forget
him&mdash;a Quarterly Reviewer. This last gentleman came with the Marquis
of Deepdene, and was, with the exception of a certain pertinacity of
manner, a very agreeable person.
</p>
<p>
Although previously unknown to the host, he had come down &ldquo;special&rdquo; under
the protection of his friend Lord Deepdene, hoping to secure his grace&rsquo;s
interest in the borough of Collyton, at that time vacant. He was a man of
very high attainments, had been an <i>optime</i> at Cambridge, was a
distinguished essayist, and his party had conceived the very greatest
expectations of his success in Parliament. Of the world, or at least that
portion of it that moves upon Tournay carpets, amid Vandykes and
Velasquez, with sideboards of gold and lamps of silver, he had not seen
much, and learned still less; and it was plain to see that, in the
confidence of his own strong head, he was proof against either the
seductions of fashion or the sneers of those who might attempt to
criticise his breeding.
</p>
<p>
Before he was twenty-four hours in the house he had corrected his grace in
an historical statement, caught up the B&mdash;&mdash; of D&mdash;&mdash;
in a blunder of prosody, detected a sapphire in Lady Dollington&rsquo;s suite of
yellow diamonds, and exposed an error of Lord Sloperton&rsquo;s in his pedigree
of Brown Menelaus. It is needless to say he was almost universally
detested, for of those he had suffered to pass free, none knew how soon
his own time might arrive. His patron was miserable; he saw nothing but
failure where he looked for triumph. The very acquirements he had built
upon for success were become a terror to every one, and &ldquo;the odious Mr.
Kitely&rdquo; became a proverb. His political opponents chuckled over the &ldquo;bad
tone&rdquo; of such men in general; the stupid ones gloried over the fall of a
clever man; and the malignant part of the household threw out broad hints
that he was a mere adventurer, and they should not wonder if actually&mdash;&mdash;
an Irishman! Indeed, he had been heard to say &ldquo;entirely&rdquo; twice upon the
same evening in conversation, and suspicion had almost become a certainty.
</p>
<p>
It was towards the end of my first week, as I was one day dressing for
dinner, Lord Collyton came hastily into my room, exclaiming, &ldquo;By Jove,
Templeton! Mr. Kitely has done the thing at last, as he would say himself,
entirely.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean? what has he done?&rdquo; &ldquo;You know my father is excessively
vain of his landscape-gardening, and the prodigious improvements which he
has made in this same demesne around us. Well, compassionating some one
whom Kitely was mangling, &lsquo;more suo&rsquo; in an argument, he took that
gentleman out for a walk, and, with a conscious pride in his own
achievements, led him towards the Swiss cottage beside the waterfall.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kitely was pleased with every thing; the timber is really well grown, and
he praised it; the view is fine, and he said so. Even of the <i>chalet</i>
he condescended a few words of approval, as a feature in the scene. The
waterfall, however, he would not praise; it might foam, and splash, and
whirl as it would; in vain it threw its tiny spray aloft, and hissed
beneath the rocks below; he never wasted even a word upon it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d scarce fancy, Mr. Kitely,&rdquo; said my father, whose patience was
sorely tried; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d scarce fancy that river you see there was only a
mill-stream.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d scarcely think of calling that mill-stream a river, my lord,&rdquo; was the
reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hence the borough of Collyton is still open, and I have come, by his
grace&rsquo;s request, to say that if you desire to enter Parliament it is very
much at your service.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This was my introduction to the House.
</p>
<p>
My parliamentary life was, as I have said, a brief one, but not without
its triumphs. I was long enough a member to have excited the ardent hopes
of my friends, and make my name a thing quoted in the lists of party.
</p>
<p>
Had I remained, I was to have spoken second to the address on the opening
of the new session. There was, I own, a most intoxicating sense of
pleasure in the first success. The moment in which, fatigued and almost
overpowered, I sank into a chair at Bellamy&rsquo;s, with some twenty around me,
congratulating, praising, flattering, and foretelling, was worth living
for; and yet, perhaps, in that same instant of triumph were sown the seeds
of my malady. I was greatly heated; I had excited myself beyond my
strength, and spoken for two hours&mdash;to myself it seemed scarce twenty
minutes; and then, with open cravat and vest, I sat in the current of air
between a door and window, drinking in delicious draughts of iced water
and flattery. I went home with a slight cough, and something strange, like
an obstruction to full breathing, in my chest. Brodie, who saw me next
day, I suppose, guessed the whole mischief; for these men look far a-head,
and, like sailors, they see storm and hurricane in the cloud not bigger
than a man&rsquo;s hand.
</p>
<p>
I often regret&mdash;I shall continue to do, perhaps, still oftener&mdash;that
I did not die in the harness. To quit the field for sake of life, and not
secure it after all, was paltry policy. But what could I do? a severe and
contested election would have killed me, and for Collyton it was
impossible I could continue to sit.
</p>
<p>
Irish politics would seem the rock a-head of every man in the House. On
these unhappy questions all are shipwrecked: the Premier loses party&mdash;Party
loses confidence&mdash;members displease constituents, and <i>protégés</i>
offend their patrons. Such was my own case: the Duke who owned the borough
of Collyton, resolved on making a great stand and show of his influence in
both Houses. All his followers, myself among the number, were summoned to
a conference, when the tactic of attack should be adopted, and each
assigned his fitting part. To me was allotted the office of replying to
the first speaker of the Treasury Bench&mdash;a post of honour and of
danger, and only distasteful because impossible: the fact was, that my own
opinions were completely with the Government on the subject in dispute,
and consequently at open variance with those of my own friends. This I
declared at once, endeavouring to shew why my judgment had so inclined,
and what arguments I believed to be unanswerable.
</p>
<p>
Instead of replying to my reasons, or convincing me of their inefficiency,
my colleagues only ap-pealed to the &ldquo;necessity of union&rdquo;&mdash;the
imperative call of party&mdash;and &ldquo;the impossibility,&rdquo; as they termed it,
&ldquo;of betraying the Duke.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I immediately resolved to resign my seat, and accept the Chiltern
Hundreds. To this there was a unanimous cry of dissent, one and all
pronouncing that such a step would damage them more even than my fiercest
opposition. The Duke sat still and said nothing. Somewhat offended at
this, I made a personal appeal to him resolving by the tone of his reply
to guide my future conduct. He was too old a politician to give me any
clue to his sentiments, shrouding his meaning in vague phrases of
compliment to my talents, and his perfect confidence that, however my
judgment inclined, I should be able to shew sufficient reasons for my
opinion. I went home baffled, worried, and ill. I sent for Brodie. &ldquo;You
cannot speak on the coming question,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;there is a great threat of
haemorrhage from the lungs&mdash;you must have rest and quiet. Keep beyond
the reach of excitement for a few weeks&mdash;don&rsquo;t even read the
newspapers. Go over to Spa&mdash;there you can be quite alone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I took the advice, and without one word of adieu to any one&mdash;without
even leaving any clue to my hiding-place, I left London. Spa was as quiet
and retired as Brodie described it. A little valley shut in among hills,
that a Cockney would have called mountains; a clear little trout-stream,
and some shady alleys to stroll among, being all I wanted. Would that I
could have brought there the tranquil spirit to enjoy them! But my mind
was far from at ease. The conflict between a sense of duty and a direct
obligation, raged continually within me. What I owed to my own conscience,
and what I owed to my patron, were at variance, and never did the
sturdiest Radical detest the system of Nomination Boroughs as I did at
this moment. Each day, too, I regretted that I had not done this or that&mdash;taken
some line different from what I adopted, and at least openly braved the
criticism that I felt I had fled from.
</p>
<p>
To deny me all access to newspapers was a measure but ill calculated to
allay the fever of my mind. Expectation and imagination were at work,
speculating on every possible turn of events, and every likely and
unlikely version of my own conduct. The first two days over, all my
impatience returned, and I would have given life itself to be once again
back &ldquo;in my place,&rdquo; to assert my opinions, and stand or fall by my own
defence of my motives.
</p>
<p>
About a week after my arrival I was sitting under the shade of some trees,
at the end of the long avenue that forms the approach to the town, when I
became suddenly aware that, at a short distance off, an Englishman was
reading aloud to his friend the report of the last debate on the &ldquo;Irish
Question.&rdquo; My attention was fettered at once; spell bound, I sat listening
to the words of one of the speakers on the ministerial side, using the
very arguments I had myself discovered, and calling down the cheers of the
House as he proceeded. A sarcastic allusion to my own absence, and a
hackneyed quotation from Horace as to my desertion, were interrupted by
loud laughter, and the reader laying down the newspaper, said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can this be the Duke of Wrexington&rsquo;s Templeton that is here alluded to?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. He wrote a paper on this subject in the last &lsquo;Quarterly,&rsquo; but the
Duke would not permit of his taking the same side in the House, and so he
affected illness they say, and came abroad.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The usual fortune of your <i>protégé</i> members&mdash;they have the
pleasant alternative of inconsistency or ingratitude. Why didn&rsquo;t he resign
his seat?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is mere coquetry with Peel. They told me at Brookes&rsquo;s that he wanted a
mission abroad, and would &lsquo;throw over&rsquo; the Duke at the first opportunity.
Now Peel gives nothing for nothing. For open apostasy he will pay, and pay
liberally; but for mere defalcation, he&rsquo;ll give nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Templeton has outwitted himself, then; besides that, he has no standing
in the House to play the game alone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A smart fellow, too, but no guidance. If he had been deep, he must have
seen that old Wrexington only gave him the borough till Collyton was of
age to come in. It was meant for Kitely, but he refused the conditions. &lsquo;I
cannot be a tenant-at-will, my lord,&rsquo; said he; and so they took
Templeton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I could bear no more. How I reached my inn I cannot remember. A severe fit
of coughing overtook me as I ascended the stairs, and a small vessel gave
way&mdash;a bad symptom, I believed; but the doctor of the place, whom my
servant soon brought to my bedside, applied leeches, and I was better a
few hours after.
</p>
<p>
The first use I made of strength was to write a brief note to the Duke,
resigning the borough. The next post brought me his reply, full of
compliment and assurance of esteem, accepting my resignation, and
acknowledging his full concurrence in the reasons I had given for my step.
The division was against him; and he half-jestingly remarked, it might
have been otherwise if I had fought on his side.
</p>
<p>
The letter was civil throughout, but in that style that shews a tone of
careless ease had been adopted to simulate frankness. I had had enough of
his Grace, and of politics too!

<h2>
CHAPTER VI.
</h2>
<p>
So, all is settled!&mdash;I leave Paris to-morrow. I hate leave-takings,
even where common acquaintanceship only is concerned. I shall just write a
few lines to the Favancourts, with the volume of Balzac&mdash;happily I
know no one else here&mdash;and then for the road!
</p>
<p>
Why this haste to set out, I cannot even tell to myself. I know, I feel, I
shall never pass this way again; I have that sense of regret a last look
at even indifferent objects suggests, and yet I would be &ldquo;en route&rdquo; There
are places and scenes I wish to see before I go hence, and I feel that my
hours are numbered.
</p>
<p>
And now for a moonlight stroll through Paris! Already the din and tumult
is subsiding&mdash;the many-voiced multitude that throngs the streets long
after the roll of equipage and the clattering hoofs of horses have ceased.
How peacefully the long shadows are sleeping in the garden of the
Tuileries! and how clearly sounds the measured tread of the sentinel
beneath the deep arch of the palace!
</p>
<p>
Not a light twinkles along that vast façade, save in that distant
pavilion, where a single star seems glistening&mdash;it is the apartment
of the King, &ldquo;The cares of Agamemnon never sleep;&rdquo; and royalty is scarce
more fortunate now than in the days of Homer.
</p>
<p>
Louis Philippe has a task not less arduous than had Napoleon to found a
dynasty. There is little prestige any longer in the name of Bourbon; and
the members of his family, brave and high-spirited though they be, are
scarcely of the stuff to stand the storm that is brewing for them.
</p>
<p>
As for the Emperor, the incapacity of his brothers was a weight upon his
shoulders all through life. His family contributed more to his fall than
is generally believed: it was a never-ending struggle he had to maintain
against the childish vanity and extravagance of Josephine, the
wrongheadedness of Joseph, the simple credulity of Louis, and the fatuous
insufficiency of Jerome and Lucien. All, more good than otherwise, were
manifestly unsuited to the places they occupied in life, and were
continually mingling up the associations and habits of their small
identities with the great requirements of newly acquired station.
</p>
<p>
Napoleon created the Empire&mdash;the vast drama was his own. However he
might please to represent royalty, however he might like to ally the
splendours of a throne with the glories of a great captain, it was all his
own doing. But how miserably deficient were the others in that faculty of
adaptation that made him &ldquo;de pair&rdquo; with every dynasty of Europe!
</p>
<p>
Into these thoughts I was led by finding myself standing in the Rue
Taibout, opposite the house which was once celebrated as the <i>Café du
Roi</i>&mdash;a name which it bore for many years under the Empire, and,
in consequence, was held in high esteem by certain worthy <i>Légitimistes</i>,
who little knew that the &ldquo;King&rdquo; was only a pretender, and, so far from
being his sainted majesty Louis Dix-huit, was merely Jerome Buonaparte,
king of Westphalia.
</p>
<p>
The name originated thus:&mdash;One warm evening in autumn, a young man,
somewhat over-dressed in the then &ldquo;<i>mode</i>&rdquo; with a very considerable
border of pinkish silk stocking seen above the margin of his low boots &ldquo;<i>à
revers</i>&rdquo; and a most inordinate amount of coat-collar, lounged along the
Boulevard Italiens, occasionally ogling the passers-by, but, oftener
still, throwing an admiring glance at himself, as the splendid windows of
plate-glass reflected back his figure. His whole air and mien exhibited
the careless <i>insouciance</i> of one with whom the world went easily,
asking little from him of exertion, less still of forethought.
</p>
<p>
He had just reached the angle of the Rue Vi-vienne, and was about to turn,
when two persons advanced towards him, whose very different style of dress
and appearance bespoke very different treatment at the hands of Fortune.
They were both young, and, although palpably men of a certain rank and
condition, were equally what is called out-at-elbows; hats that exhibited
long intimacy with rain and wind, shoes of very questionable colour, coats
suspiciously buttoned about the throat, being all signs of circumstances
that were far from flourishing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Chopard, is&rsquo;t thou?&rdquo; said the fashionably dressed man, advancing with
open hand to each, and speaking in the &ldquo;tu&rdquo; of intimate friendship, &ldquo;And
thou, too, Brissole, how goes it? What an age since we have met! Art long
in Paris?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;About two hours,&rdquo; said the first. &ldquo;Just as I stepped out of the Place des
Victoires I met our old friend here; and, strange enough, now we have come
upon <i>you</i>; three old schoolfellows thus assembled at a hazard!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A minute later, and we should have missed each other,&rdquo; said Brissole. &ldquo;I
was about to take my place in the <i>malle</i> for Nancy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To leave Paris?&rdquo; exclaimed both the others.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Even so&mdash;to leave Paris! I&rsquo;ve had enough of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, what do you mean by this?&rdquo; said Cho-pard; &ldquo;it sounds very like
discouragement to me, who have come up here with all manner of notions of
fortune, wealth, and honours.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So much the worse for you,&rdquo; said Brissole, gaily; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried it for five
years, and will try it no longer. I was vaudevillist, journalist,
novelist, feuilletonist&mdash;I was the glory of the Odéon&mdash;the prop
of the &lsquo;Moniteur&rsquo;&mdash;the hope of the &lsquo;Siècle&rsquo;&mdash;and look at me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And thou?&rdquo; said the fashionable, addressing him called Chopard.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have just had a little opera damned at Lyons, and have come up to try
what can be done here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo; exclaimed Brissole, shrugging his shoulders; then, turning
abruptly towards the other, he said, &ldquo;And what is thy luck? for, so far as
externals go, thou seemest to have done better.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, Jerome,&rdquo; chimed in Chopard, &ldquo;tell us, how hast thou fared?&mdash;thou
wert ever a fortunate fellow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; said he, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from St. Cloud&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
made me King of Westphalia!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The devil they have!&rdquo; exclaimed Chopard; &ldquo;and dost know, <i>par hazard</i>,
where thy kingdom lies on the map?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why should he torment himself about that?&rdquo; said Brissole. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to
know they have capital hams there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What if we sup together,&rdquo; said Jerome, &ldquo;and taste one? I am most anxious
to baptize my new Royalty in a glass of wine. Here we are in the Rue
Taibout&mdash;this is Villaret&rsquo;s. Come in, gentlemen&mdash;I&rsquo;m the host.
Make your minds easy about the future: you, Brissole, I appoint to the
office of my Private Secretary. Chopard, you shall be <i>Maître de
Chapelle</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; cried the others gaily; and with a hearty shake of hands was the
contract ratified.
</p>
<p>
Supper was quickly prepared, and, in its splendour and profusion,
pronounced, by both the guests, worthy of a king. Villaret could do these
things handsomely, and as he was told expense was of no consequence, the
entertainment was really magnificent. Nor was the spirit of the guests
inferior to the feast. They were brilliant in wit, and overflowing in
candour; concealing nothing of their past lives that would amuse or
interest, each vied with the other in good stories and ludicrous
adventures&mdash;all their bygone vicissitudes so pleasantly contrasting
with the brilliant future they now saw opening before them. They drank
long life and reign to the King of Westphalia in bumpers of foaming
champagne.
</p>
<p>
The pleasant hours flew rapidly past&mdash;bright visions of the time to
come lending their charm to the happiness, and making their enjoyment seem
but the forerunner of many days and nights of festive delight. At last
came day-break, and, even by the flickering of reason left, they saw it
was time to separate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bring the bill,&rdquo; said Jerome to the exhausted-looking waiter, who
speedily appeared with a small slip of paper ominously marked &ldquo;eight
hundred francs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Diable!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Jerome; &ldquo;that is smart, and I have no money
about me. Come, Brissole, this falls among your duties&mdash;pay the
fellow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Parbleu</i>, then&mdash;it comes somewhat too soon. I am not yet
installed, and have not got the key of our treasury.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No matter&mdash;pay it out of thine own funds.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I have none&mdash;save this;&rdquo; and he produced two francs, and some
sous in copper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, Chopard must do it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have not as much as himself,&rdquo; said Chopard.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Send the landlord here,&rdquo; said Jerome; but indeed the command was
unnecessary, as that functionary had been an anxious listener at the door
to the very singular debate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have forgotten our purses, Villaret,&rdquo; said Jerome, in the easy tone
his last ten hours of royalty suggested; &ldquo;but we will send your money when
we reach home.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt of it, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the host, obsequiously; &ldquo;but it
would please me still better to receive it now&mdash;particularly as I
have not the honour of knowing the distinguished company.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The distinguished company is perfectly satisfied to know you: the <i>cuisine</i>
was excellent,&rdquo; hiccupped Brissole.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the wine unexceptionable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The champagne might have been a little more <i>frappé</i>,&rdquo; said
Brissole; &ldquo;the only improvement I could suggest.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps there was a <i>nuance</i>, only a <i>nuance</i>, too much citron
in the <i>rognons à la broche</i>, but the <i>filets de sole</i> were
perfect.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I had the happiness of knowing &lsquo;<i>Messieurs</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Villaret, &ldquo;I
should hope, that at another time I might be more fortunate in pleasing
them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing easier,&rdquo; said Chopard. &ldquo;I am <i>Maître de Chapelle</i> to the
King of Westphalia.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Villaret bowed low.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I am the Private Secretary and Privy Purse of his majesty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Villaret bowed again&mdash;a slight smile of very peculiar omen flitting
across his cunning features, while, turning hastily, he whispered a word
in the ear of the waiter. &ldquo;And this gentleman here?&rdquo; said he, looking at
Jerome, who, with his legs resting on a chair, was coolly awaiting the
termination of the explanation. &ldquo;And this gentleman, if I might make so
bold, what office does he hold in his Majesty&rsquo;s service?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am the King of Westphalia!&rdquo; said Jerome.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just as I suspected. François,&rdquo; said the landlord insolently, &ldquo;go fetch
the gendarmes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, <i>parbleu!</i>&rdquo; said Jerome, springing up in alarm; &ldquo;no
gendarmes, no police. Here, take my watch&mdash;that is surely worth more
than your bill? When I reach home I&rsquo;ll send the money.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The landlord, more than ever convinced that his suspicions were well
grounded, took the watch, which was a very handsome one, and suffered them
to depart in peace.
</p>
<p>
They had not been gone many minutes when, on examining the watch, the
landlord perceived that it bore the emblematic &ldquo;N&rdquo; of the Emperor within
the case, and at once suspecting that it had been stolen from some member
of the imperial household, he hurried off in terror to communicate his
fears to the commissary of police. This functionary no sooner saw it that
he hastened to Fouché, the minister, who, making himself acquainted with
the whole details, immediately hurried off to the Tuileries and laid it
all before the Emperor. The watch had been a present from Napoleon to
Jerome; but this was but a small part of the cause of indignation. The
derogation from dignity, the sacrifice of the regard due to his station,
were crimes of a very different order; and, summoned to the imperial
presence, the new-made king was made to hear, in terms of reproachful
sarcasm, a lesson in his craft that few could impart with such cutting
severity.
</p>
<p>
As for the <i>Maître de Chapelle</i> and the Secretary, an agent of the
police waited on each before they were well awake, with strict injunctions
to them to maintain a perfect secrecy on the whole affair; and while
guaranteeing them an annual pension in their new offices, assuring them
that the slightest indiscretion as to the mystery would involve their ruin
and their exile from France for ever.
</p>
<p>
It was years before the landlord learned the real secret of the adventure,
and, in commemoration of it, called his house &ldquo;Le Café du Roi,&rdquo; a
circumstance which the Government never noticed, for the campaign of
Russia and the events of 1812-13 left little time to attend to matters of
this calibre.
</p>
<p>
The Café du Roi is now a shop where artificial flowers are sold; as nearly
like nature perhaps, or more so, than poor Jerome&rsquo;s royalty resembled the
real article.

<h2>
CHAPTER VII.
</h2>
<p>
Baden-Baden. It is like a dream to me now to think of that long, dusty
road from Paris, with its rattling pavement, its noisy postilions,
shouting ostlers, bowing landlords, dirty waiters, garlic diet, and hard
beds; and here I sit by my open window, with a bright river beneath my
feet, the song of birds on every side, a richly wooded mountain in front,
and at the foot a winding road, which ever and anon gives glimpses of some
passing equipage, bright in all the butterfly glitter of female dress, or,
mayhap, resounding with merry laughter and sweet-voiced mirth. How
brilliant is every thing!&mdash;the cloudless sky, the sparkling water,
the emerald grass, the foliage in every tint of beauty, the orange-trees
and the cactus along the terraces, where lounging parties come and go; and
then the measured step of princely equipages, in all the panoply of
tasteful wealth! Truly, Vice wears its holiday suit in Baden, and the
fairness of this lovely valley seems to throw a softened light over a
scene where, as in a sea, the stormy waves of every bad passion are
warring.
</p>
<p>
When, in all the buoyant glow of youth and health, I remembered feeling
shocked, as I strolled through the promenade at Carlsbad, at the sight of
so many painful objects of sickness and suffering; the eager, almost
agonising, expressions of hoping convalescence; the lustreless stare of
those past hope; the changeful looks of accompanying friends, who seemed
to read the fate of some dear one in the compassionate pity of those who
passed, were all sights that threw a chill, like death, over the warm
current of my blood. Yet never did this feeling convey the same intense
horror and disgust that I felt last night as I walked through the Cursaal.
</p>
<p>
To pass from the mellow moonlight, dappling the pathway among the trees
and kissing the rippling stream, from the calm, mild air of a summer&rsquo;s
night, when every leaf lay sleeping and none save the nightingale kept
watch, into the glare and glitter of a gilded saloon, is somewhat trying
to the jarred nerves of sickness. But what was it to the sight of that
dense crowd around the play-table, where avarice, greed of gain,
recklessness, and despair are mingled, giving, even to faces of manly
vigour and openness, expressions of low cunning and vulgar meaning? There
is a terrible sameness in the gambler&rsquo;s look, a blending of slavish terror
with a resolution to brave the worst, almost demoniacal in its fierceness.
I knew most of the persons present; I need not say, not personally, but
from having seen them before at various other similar places. Many were
professed gamblers, men who starved and suffered for the enjoyment of that
one passion, living on the smallest gain, and never venturing a stake
beyond what daily life demanded; haggard, sad, wretched-looking creatures
they were, the abject poverty of their dress and appearance vouching that
this <i>métier</i> was not a prosperous one. Others farmed out their
talents, and played for those who were novices. These men have a singular
existence; they exact a mere per-centage on the winning, and are in great
request among elderly ladies, whose passion for play is modified by the
fears of its vicissitudes. Then there were the usual sprinkling of young
men, not habitually gamblers, but always glad to have the opportunity of
tempting Fortune, with here and there some old votary of the &ldquo;table&rdquo;
 satisfied to witness the changeful temper of the game without risking a
stake.
</p>
<p>
Into many vices men are led by observing the apparent happiness and
pleasure of others who indulge in them. Not so with regard to play. No man
ever became a gambler from this delusion, there being no such terrible
warning against the passion as the very looks of its votaries.
</p>
<p>
But it is not in such a low <i>tripot</i> of vice I care to linger. It was
a ball-night, and I turned with a sense of relief from the aspect of
sordid, vulgar iniquity, to gaze on its more polished brother (<i>quore</i>,
sister?) in the <i>salle de danse</i>.
</p>
<p>
Here there was a large&mdash;I might almost call it a brilliant&mdash;company
assembled: a less exclusive assemblage cannot be conceived; five francs
and clean gloves being the only qualification needed. The guests were as
varied, too, in nation as in rank. About equal numbers of German and
French, several Russians, and a large proportion of English, with, here
and there, a bilious-looking American, or a very dubious Marquis from
beyond the Alps. Many of the men I knew to be swindlers and blacklegs of
the very lowest stamp; some others I recognised as persons of the highest
station in my own country. Of the lady part of the company the disparities
were even greater.
</p>
<p>
There was, it is true, a species of sifting process discernible, by which
the various individuals fell among those of their own order; but though
this was practicable enough where conversation and grouping were
concerned, it was scarcely attainable in other circumstances, and thus,
the Mazurka and the Polka assembled ingredients that should never have
been placed in close propinquity.
</p>
<p>
The demoralising influence of such <i>reunions</i> upon the daughters of
our own land need not be insisted upon. Purity of mind and simplicity of
character are no safeguard against the scenes which, in all the propriety
of decorum, are ever occurring. And how terribly rapid are the downward
steps when the first bloom and blush of modesty have faded! It demands but
a very indifferent power of observation to distinguish the English girl
for the first time abroad from her who has made repeated visits to foreign
watering-places; while even among those who have been habituated to the
great world at home, and passed the ordeal of London seasons, there is yet
much to learn in the way of cool and self-possessed effrontery, from the
habits of Baden and its brethren.
</p>
<p>
I was dreadfully shocked last night by meeting one I had not seen for many
years before. How changed from what I knew her once!&mdash;what a terrible
change! When first I saw her, it was during a visit I made to her mother&rsquo;s
house in Wales; her brother was an Oxford friend, and brought me down with
him for the shooting season to Merionethshire. Poor fellow! he died of
consumption at two-and-twenty, and left all he possessed&mdash;a handsome
estate&mdash;to his only sister. Hence all her misery! Had she remained
comparatively portionless, rich only in her beauty and the graces of a
manner that was fascination itself, she might now have been the happy wife
of some worthy Englishman&mdash;one whose station is a trust held on the
tenure of his rectitude and honour; for such is public feeling in our
country, and such is it never elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
She was then about eighteen or nineteen, and the very ideal of what an
English girl at that age should be. On a mind highly stored and amply
cultivated, no unworthy or depreciating influence had yet descended;
freedom of thought, freshness almost childish, had given her an animation
and buoyancy only subdued by the chastening modesty of coming womanhood.
Enthusiastic in all her pursuits, for they were graceful and elevating,
her mind had all the simplicity of the child with the refinement of the
highest culture; and, like those who are brought up in narrow circles, her
affections for a few spread themselves out in the varied forms that are
often scattered and diffused over the wider surface of the world. Thus her
brother was not merely the great object of her affection and pride, but he
was the companion of her rides and walks, the confidant of all her secret
feelings, the store in which she laid up her newly acquired knowledge, or
drew, at will, for more. With him she read and studied; delighted by the
same pursuits, their natures blended into one harmonious <i>corde</i>,
which no variance or dissonance ever troubled.
</p>
<p>
His death, although long and gradually anticipated, nearly brought her to
the grave. The terrible nature of the malady, so often inherent in the
same family, gave cause for the most anxious fears on her account, and her
mother, herself almost brokenhearted, took her abroad, hoping by the
mildness of a southern climate and change of scene to arrest the progress
of the fell disease.
</p>
<p>
In this she was successful; bodily health was indeed secured. But might it
not have been better that she had wasted slowly away, to sleep at last
beneath the yews of her own ancient churchyard, than live and become what
she has done?
</p>
<p>
Some years after this event I was, although at the time only an <i>attaché</i>
of the mission, acting as <i>Charge d&rsquo;affaires</i> at Naples, during the
absence of the minister and the secretary. I was sitting one morning
reading in my garden, when my servant announced the visit of an Italian
gentleman, il Signor Salvatori. The name was familiar to me, as belonging
to a man who had long been employed as a Spy of the Austrian government,
and, indeed, was formerly entrusted in a secret capacity by Lord W.
Bentinck in Sicily&mdash;a clever, designing, daring rascal, who obtained
his information no one knew how; and although we had always our suspicions
that he might be &ldquo;selling&rdquo; us, as well as the French, we never actually
traced any distinct act of treachery to his door. He possessed a
considerable skill in languages, was very highly informed on many popular
topics, and, I have been told, was a musician of no mean powers of
performance. These and similar social qualities were, however, never
displayed by him in any part of his intercourse with us, although we had
often heard of their existence.
</p>
<p>
As I never felt any peculiar pleasure in the relations which office
compels with men of his stamp, I received him somewhat coldly, and asked,
without much circumlocution, the reason of his visit.
</p>
<p>
He replied, with his habitual smile of self-possession, that his present
duty at &ldquo;the Mission&rdquo; was not a business-call, but concerned a matter
purely personal;&mdash;in fact, &ldquo;with his Excellency&rsquo;s permission, he
desired to get married.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Not stopping him on the score of his investing me with a title to which,
no one knew better than himself, I had no pretensions, I quietly assured
him that his relation with &ldquo;the Mission&rdquo; did not, in any way, necessitate
his asking for such a permission&mdash;that, however secret and mysterious
the nature of his communications, they were still beyond the pale of
affairs personally private.
</p>
<p>
He suffered me to continue my explanation, somewhat scornful as it was, to
the end, and then calmly said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Excellency will pardon my intrusion, when I inform you that the
marriage should take place here, at &lsquo;the Mission,&rsquo; as the lady is an
English woman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Whether it was the fact itself, or his manner of delivering it, that
outraged me, I cannot now remember; but I do recollect giving expression
to a sentiment of surprise and anger not exactly suitable.
</p>
<p>
He merely smiled, and said nothing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well, M. Salvatori,&rdquo; said I, corrected by the quietude of his
manner; &ldquo;what is your day?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wednesday, if your Excellency pleases.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wednesday be it, and at eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As your Excellency desires,&rdquo; said he, bowing and retiring.
</p>
<p>
It had never occurred to me to ask for any information about the happy
fair one; indeed, if I had given a thought at all to the matter, it would
have been that she was of the rank of a <i>femme-de-chambre</i>, or, at
least, some unhappy children&rsquo;s governess, glad to exchange one mode of
tyranny for another. As he was leaving the room, however, some sense of
remorse, perhaps, at the <i>brusquerie</i> I had shewn towards him,
suggested the question, &ldquo;Who might the lady be?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mademoiselle Graham.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah! a very good name, indeed,&rdquo; said I; and so, with a word or two of
common-place, I bade him good-by.
</p>
<p>
The Wednesday morning arrived, and two carriages drove into the court of
&ldquo;the Mission:&rdquo; out of one sprung Signor Salvatori and a very bearded
gentleman, who accompanied him as his friend; from the other alighted,
first, an elderly lady, whose dress was a mixture of wedding finery and
widow&rsquo;s mourning; then came a very elegant-looking girl, veiled from head
to foot, followed by her maid; and, lastly, the chaplain to &ldquo;the Mission.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They were some minutes too early, and I equally behind my time; but I
dressed hastily, and descended to the salon, where M. Salvatori received
me with a very gracious expression of his self-satisfaction. Passing him
by, I advanced to address a few words to the old lady, who had risen from
her seat; when, stepping back, I exclaimed,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Graham&mdash;my old friend, Mrs. Graham! Is this possible?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Caroline, it is Mr. Templeton!&rdquo; said she; while her daughter, drawing
her veil still closer over her face, trembled dreadfully. Meanwhile Mrs.
Graham had seized my hand with cordial warmth, and pressed it in all the
earnestness of friendship. Her joy&mdash;and it was very evident it was
such&mdash;was little participated in by her son-in-law elect, who stood,
pale and conscience-stricken, in a distant part of the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must entreat these gentlemen&rsquo;s permission to speak a few words here
alone, as these ladies are very old friends I have not seen for some
years.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would humbly suggest to your Excellency that, as the ceremony still
waits&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish it, Marquis,&rdquo; said Mrs. Graham, in a tone half-command,
half-entreaty; and, with a deep bow of submission, Salvatori and his
friend withdrew, accompanied by the chaplain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The title by which you have just addressed that person, Mrs. Graham,&rdquo;
 said I, in a voice trembling from agitation, &ldquo;shews me how you have been
duped and deceived by him, and in what total ignorance you are as to his
real character.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Templeton!&rdquo; broke in her daughter, now speaking for the first
time, and in accents I shall never forget, such was their heart-thrilling
earnestness,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, sir, this does indeed exceed the license of even
old friendship! We are well aware how the Marquis of Salvatori has
suffered from persecution; but we little expected to have found <i>you</i>
among the number of his enemies.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You do me great wrong, Miss Graham,&rdquo; said I, eagerly; &ldquo;in nothing greater
than supposing me capable of being the enemy of such a man as this.
Unworthy as the sentiment is, it at least implies a sense of equality.
Now, are you certain of what this person is? are you aware in what
capacity he has been employed by our government, and by that of other
countries?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We know that the Marquis has been engaged in secret missions,&rdquo; said Miss
Graham, proudly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your reply, brief as it is, conveys two errors, Miss Graham. He is not a
Marquis; little as the title often implies in Italy, he has no right to
it. He asked Lord William Bentinck to let him call himself Marquis, and so
to address him, as a means of frequenting circles where important
information was accessible. Lord William said, &lsquo;Call yourself what you
please&mdash;Grand Duke, if you like it&mdash;I am no dispenser of such
designations.&rsquo; The gentleman was modest;&mdash;he stopped at Marquis. As
to his diplomatic functions, we have a short and expressive word for them;&mdash;he
was and is, a Spy!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Not heeding the scornful reception of the daughter, I turned towards Mrs.
Graham, and, with all the power I possessed, urged her, at least, to defer
this fatal step;&mdash;that she was about to bestow her child upon a man
of notoriously degraded character, and one whose assumption of rank and
position was disregarded and despised in the very humblest circles. The
mother wept bitterly; at one moment, turning to dissuade her daughter from
her rashness, at the next, appealing to me against what she called my
unjust prejudices against the Marquis. Miss Graham scornfully refused to
vouchsafe me even a word.
</p>
<p>
I confess more than once my temper prompted me to abandon the enterprise,
and suffer wilfulness to reap its own bitter harvest; but then, my better
feelings prevailed, and old memories of my poor friend Graham again
enlisted me in defence of his sister.
</p>
<p>
Of no avail was it that I followed these worthier promptings. It seemed as
if the man had thrown a spell over these two unhappy women, one, being
perfectly enthralled, the other, nearly so, by the artful fascinations of
his manner; and yet he was neither young, handsome, rich, nor of high
lineage. On the contrary, the man was at least fifty-three or four, a
perfect monster of ugliness, with an ex-pression of sardonic sycophancy
actually demoniac.
</p>
<p>
If I were not relating &ldquo;a fact&rdquo;&mdash;one of which I can answer, that many
now living can entirely corroborate&mdash;I would hesitate about dwelling
on a case where improbabilities are so strong, and where I have nothing to
offer like an explanation of them. Wilkes has long since convinced the
world how little good looks are concerned in winning a woman&rsquo;s heart, and
how, indeed, a very considerable share of ugliness can be counterbalanced
by captivations of manner and personal agreeability. But, judging from the
portraits&mdash;even Hogarth&rsquo;s fearful sketch&mdash;Wilkes was handsome
compared to Salvatori; and in point of reputation, low as it was, the
Libeller and the Satirist was still better than the Spy.
</p>
<p>
To go back again: I argued, I entreated, begged, threatened, and
denounced. I went further;&mdash;I actually transgressed the limits of
official authority, and refused to sanction the ceremony&mdash;a threat
which, I soon remembered, I dare not sustain. But, do what, say what, I
would, they were equally resolute and determined; and nothing was left for
me but to recall M. Salvatori and his friend, and suffer the affair to
proceed.
</p>
<p>
I do not remember, among the varied incidents of my life, one whose effect
weighed more heavily upon me. Although acquitted by my conscience, I felt
at moments horror-struck at even my share in this infamy, and would have
given any thing that it had never occurred. It may be believed I was happy
to hear that they all left Naples the same day.
</p>
<p>
Years rolled over, and I never even heard of them, till one morning, when
waiting along with a diplomatic friend for an interview with the French
Minister for Foreign Affairs, a person hastily passed through the room,
saluting us as he went.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have seen that face before,&rdquo; said I to my friend; &ldquo;do you know him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; said he, smiling; &ldquo;one must be young in diplomacy not to
know the Mephistophiles of the craft; and I guess why he is here, too:
that fellow is in the pay of the Prince de Capua, but has sold him to
Louis Philippe. The reconciliation with Naples would have been long since
effected but for the King of the French.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And his name&mdash;this man&rsquo;s name&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Salvatori.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! the same who married an English girl at Naples?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And sold her to the Marquis Brandini for ten thousand sequini. The very
man. But here comes the messenger to say his Excellency will receive us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
My friend quitted Paris the moment his interview ended, and I heard no
more.
</p>
<p>
Last night I saw her in the Cursaal&mdash;beautiful, perhaps more
beautiful than ever! At least there was a lofty elegance and a splendour
about her that I never remember in her girlish days; nor was it till she
smiled that I could now believe that the queen-like beauty before me was
the timid, delicate girl I first saw tripping along the narrow path of a
Welsh mountain.
</p>
<p>
Even from the gossip of Baden I could learn no more about her than that
she was a Sicilian Countess of great wealth, and a widow; that she was
intimately received into the very highest circles&mdash;even of royalty&mdash;and
constantly was seen driving in the carriage of the Archduchess. It was,
then, possible that I might be mistaken, after all! Great people are not
accessible so easily.
</p>
<p>
I tried in various quarters to get presented to her&mdash;for she shewed
not the slightest sign of having ever met me&mdash;but failed every where:
they who knew her did not do so intimately enough to introduce me.
</p>
<p>
The reminiscences I have just jotted down have made me miserably feverish
and ill; for although I now begin to doubt that I ever saw this Countess
before, the sad story of Caroline Graham is ever present to my mind&mdash;a
terrible type of the fortune of many a fair English girl left to the
merciless caprice of a foreign husband!
</p>
<p>
I am not bigot enough to fancy that happy, eminently happy, marriages do
not exist abroad as well as with us; but I am fully minded to say that the
individuals should be of the same nation, reared in the midst of the same
traditions, imbued with feelings that a common country, language, and
religion bestow.
</p>
<p>
I know of nothing that presents so pitiable a picture of unhappy destiny,
as a fair and delicately minded English girl the wife of a foreigner! How
I wish to resolve my doubts in this case! for although I began this
memorandum fully persuaded it was Caroline Graham that I had seen, every
line I write increases my uncertainty.

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII.
</h2>
<p>
It was with a rare audacity that the devil pitched his tent in Baden!
Perhaps, on the whole continent, another spot could not be found so fully
combining, in a small circuit, as many charms of picturesque scenery; and
it was a bold conception to set down vice, in all its varieties, in the
very midst of&mdash;in open contrast as it were to&mdash;a scene of
peaceful loveliness and beauty.
</p>
<p>
I do confess myself one of those who like living figures in a landscape. I
like not only those groupings which artists seem to stereotype, so nearly
alike they all are, of seated foreground figures, dark-shadowed observers
of a setting sun, or coolly watering cattle beneath a gushing fountain. I
like not merely the red-kirtled peasant knee-deep in the river, or the
patient fisherman upon his rock; but I have a strong regard&mdash;I mean
here, where the scene is Nature&rsquo;s own, and not on canvass&mdash;a strong
regard for those flitting glimpses of the gayer world, which, in the
brightest tints that Fashion sanctions, are caught now, in some deep dell
of the Tyrol, now, on some snow-peaked eminence of a Swiss glacier, beside
the fast-rolling Danube or the sluggish Nile.
</p>
<p>
I have no sympathy for those who exclaim against the incongruity of pink
parasols and blue reticules in scenes of mild and impressive grandeur.
Methinks it bespeaks but scanty store of self-resources in those who thus
complain, not knowing any thing of the feelings that have prompted their
presence there. No one holds cheaper than I do the traveller who, under
the guidance of his John Murray, sees what is set down for him through the
eyes of the &ldquo;Hand-book&rdquo;&mdash;mingling up in his addled brain crude
notions of history and antiquarianism with the names of inns and
post-houses&mdash;counsels against damp sheets&mdash;cheating landlords&mdash;scraps
of geology, and a verse of &ldquo;Childe Harold.&rdquo; This is detestable: but for
otherwise is the meeting with those whose dress and demeanour tell of the
world of fashion&mdash;the intertwined life of dissipation and excess in
solitary unfrequented places. Far from being struck by their inaptitude
and unfitness for such scenes, I willingly fall back upon the thought of
how such people must be impressed by objects so far beyond the range of
daily experience, of objects, whose wondrous meaning speaks to hearts the
most cloyed and jaded, &ldquo;as never man spoke.&rdquo; I can luxuriate in fancying
how long-forgotten feelings, old memories of the past, long buried beneath
the load of daily cares, come back fresh and bright under the influence of
associations that recall parer, happier hours. I can dwell in imagination
on the sudden spring made from the stern ordinances of a world of forms
and conventionalities, to that more beautiful and grander world, whose
incense is the odour of wild flowers and whose music is the falling
cataract.
</p>
<p>
I love to speculate how the statesman, the wily man of forecasting thought
and deep devices, must feel in presence of agencies which make those of
mere man&rsquo;s contrivance seem poor and contemptible; and how the fine lady,
whose foot knows no harder surface than a velvet carpet, and whose
artificial existence palls by its own voluptuousness, contemplates a
picture of grand and stern sublimity. Disguise it how they will, feign
indifference how they may, such scenes always are felt, and deeply felt!
The most accomplished lounger of St. James&rsquo;s Street does not puff his
cigar so coolly as he affects to do, nor is that heart all unmoved that
throbs beneath the graceful folds of a rich Cashmere. Now and then some
Brummagem spirit intrudes, who sees in the felling torrent but a wasted
&ldquo;water-power:&rdquo; but even he has his own far-reaching thoughts imbued with a
poetry of their own. He sees in these solitudes new cities arise, the busy
haunts of acting heads and hands; he hears in imagination the heavy bang
of the iron hammer, the roar of the furnace, the rush of steam, the
many-voiced multitude called by active labour to new activity of mind; and
perhaps he soars away, in thought, to those far-off wilds of the new
world, whose people, clothed by these looms, are brought thus into
brotherhood with their kindred men.
</p>
<p>
I, myself, have few sympathies in common with these; but I respect the
feelings that I do not fathom. &ldquo;<i>Nihil humani a me alienum puto</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
What has suggested these thoughts? A little excursion that I made this
evening from the village of Lichtenthal towards the Waterfall, a winding
glen, narrowing as you advance; wilder too, but not less peopled; every
sheltered spot having its own dwelling-place&mdash;the picturesque <i>chalet</i>,
with its far-stretching eave, and its quaint galleries of carved wood, its
brightly shining windows sparkling between the clustering vine-leaves, and
its frieze of Indian corn hung up beneath the roof to dry. Leaving the
carriage, I followed the bank of the stream&mdash;just such a river as in
my boyish days I loved to linger by, and fancy I was fishing. It was no
more than fancy: for although my rod and landing-net were in most fitting
perfection, my hackles and orange bodies, my green drakes and may-flies,
all that could be wished, I was too dreamy and <i>destrait</i> for &ldquo;the
gentle craft;&rdquo; and liked Walton better in his rambling discursions than in
his more practical teaching. What a glorious day for scenery, too! Not one
of those scorching, blue sky, cloudless days, when a general hardness
prevails, but a mingled light of sun and cloud shadow, with misty
distances, and dark, deep foregrounds on the still water, where ever and
anon a heavy plash, breaking in widening circles, told of the speckled
trout: save that, no other sound was heard. All was calm and noiseless, as
in some far-off valley of the Mississippi, a little surging of the water
on the rocky shore&mdash;a faint melancholy plash&mdash;scarce heard even
in the stillness.
</p>
<p>
I sat thinking, not sadly, but seriously, of the past, and of that present
time that was so soon to add itself to the Past; for the Future, I felt,
by sensations that never deceive, it must be brief! My malady gained
rapidly on me; symptoms, I was told to guard against, had already shewn
themselves, and I knew that the battle was fought and lost.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is sad to die at thirty,&rdquo; saith Balzac, somewhere; and to the
Frenchman of Paris, who feels that death is the cessation of a round of
pleasures and dissipations, whose hold is hourly stronger; who thinks that
life and self-indulgence are synonymous; whose ideal is the ceaseless
round of exciting sensations that spring from every form of human passion
nurtured to excess;&mdash;to him, the sleep of the grave is the solitude
and not the repose of the tomb.
</p>
<p>
To me, almost alone in the world, to die suggests few sorrows or regrets;
without family, without friends, save those the world&rsquo;s complaisance calls
such; with no direct object for exertion, nothing for hope or fear to
cling to; no ambition that I could nourish, no dream of greatness or
distinction to elevate me above the thought of daily suffering; life is a
mere monotony&mdash;and the monotony of <i>waiting</i>.
</p>
<p>
While watching the progress of my malady, seeing day by day the advancing
steps of the disease that never sleeps, I recognise in myself a strange
adaptation in my mind and feelings to the more developed condition of my
illness. At first, my cough irritated and fevered me. It awoke me if I
slept&mdash;it worried me as I read; my fast and hurried breathing, too,
exciting the heart&rsquo;s action, rendered me impatient and discontented. Now,
both these symptoms are in excess, and yet, by habit and some acquired
power of conforming to them, I am scarcely aware of their existence. I
have learned to look on them as my normal, natural condition. My cough on
awaking in the morning&mdash;my hectic as night falls&mdash;only tell of
the day&rsquo;s dawn and decline. I fancy that this dreamy calm, this spirit of
submissive waiting that I feel, is dependent on my infirmity; for how
otherwise could I, if strong in mind and body, endure the thraldom of my
present life? The watchful egotism of sickness demands the mind of
sickness.
</p>
<p>
In the whole phenomena of malady, nothing is more striking than the
accommodation of the mind to the condition of suffering. I remember once&mdash;I
was then in all the strength and confidence of youth and health&mdash;discussing
this point with a friend, a physician of skill and eminence, now no more,
and was greatly struck by a theory which was new, at least to me. He
regarded every species of disease, from the most simple to the most
complicated, as a sanatory process, an effort&mdash;not always successful,
of course&mdash;on the part of Nature to restore the system to its
condition of health. He instanced maladies the most formidable, some of
them attended by symptoms of terrible suffering; but in every case he
assumed to shew that they were efforts to oppose the march of some other
species of disorganisation. So far from there being any taint of
Materialism in these views, he deduced from them a most devout and
conscientious belief in a Supreme Power; and instead of resting upon
Contrivance and Design as the great attributes of the Deity, he went
further, and made the Forethought, the Providence of God for his
creatures, the great object of his wonderment and praise. His argument, if
I dare trust my memory, was briefly this: The presence of a superintending
guardian spirit, ever watchful to avert evil from its charge, is the
essential difference which separates every object of God&rsquo;s creation from
the mere work of man&rsquo;s hand. The ingenuity that contrived the mechanism of
a steam-engine or a clock, was yet unable to endow the machinery with
latent powers of reparation; secret resources against accident or decay,
treasured up for the hour of necessity, and not even detectable, if
existent, before the emergency that evoked them. Not so with the objects
of creation. <i>They</i> are each and all, according to various laws,
provided with such powers; their operations, whether from deficient energy
or misdirection, constituting what we call disease. What is dropsy, for
instance, save the resolution of an inflammatory action that would almost
inevitably prove fatal? Formidable as the malady is, it yet affords time
for treatment; its march is comparatively slow and uniform, whereas the
disease that originated it would have caused death, if effusion of fluid
had not arrested the violence of the inflammation.
</p>
<p>
Take the most simple case&mdash;a wounded bloodvessel, a cut finger: by
all the laws of hydraulics, the blood must escape from this small vessel,
and the individual bleed to death as certainly, though not so speedily, as
from the largest artery. But what ensues? after a slight loss of blood,
the vessel contracts&mdash;a coagulum forms&mdash;the bleeding is arrested&mdash;the
coagulum solidifies and forms a cicatrix; and the whole of these varied
processes&mdash;a series of strange and wonderful results&mdash;will
follow, without any interference of the Will, far less any aid from the
individual himself, being powers inherent in the organisation, and
providentially stored up for emergency.
</p>
<p>
The blood poured out upon the brain from an apoplectic stroke, must, and
does, prove fatal, save when the <i>vis medicatrix</i> is able to
interpose in time, by encircling the fluid, enclosing it with a <i>sac</i>,
and subsequently by absorption removing the extraneous pressure. All these
are vital processes, over which the sufferer has no control&mdash;of which
he is not even conscious.
</p>
<p>
The approach of an abscess to the surface of the body, by a law similar to
that which determines the approach of a plant to the surface of the earth&mdash;the
reparation of a fractured bone, by the creation and disposition of
elements not then existing in the body&mdash;and many similar cases,
warranted him in assuming that all these processes were exactly analogous
to what we call disease, being disturbances of the animal economy
accompanied by pain; and that disease of every kind was only a curative
effort, occasionally failing from sufficient energy&mdash;occasionally,
from the presence of antagonistic agency,&mdash;and occasionally, from our
ignorance of its tendency and object.
</p>
<p>
I feel I have been a lame expositor of my friend&rsquo;s theory. I have omitted
many of his proofs&mdash;some of them the best and strongest. I have,
besides, not adverted to objections which he foresaw and refuted. Indeed,
I fell into the digression without even knowing it, and I leave it here in
the same fashion. I fancy a kind of comfort in the notion that my malady
is, at least, an attempt at restoration. The idea of decay&mdash;of
declining slowly away, leaf by leaf, branch by branch&mdash;is very sad;
and even this &ldquo;conceit&rdquo; is not without its consolation.
</p>
<p>
And now to wander homewards. How houseless the man is who calls his inn
his home! It was all very well for &ldquo;Sir John&rdquo; to say, &ldquo;I like to take mine
ease in mine inn;&rdquo; and in his day the thing was practicable. The little
parlour, with its wainscot of walnut-wood and its bright tiles, all
shining in the tempered light through the diamond-paned window; the neatly
spread table, where smoked the pasty of high-seasoned venison, beside the
tall cup of sack or canary; and the buxom landlady herself, redolent of
health, good spirits, and broad jest;&mdash;these were all accessories to
that abandonment to repose and quiet so delightful to the weary-minded.
But think of some &ldquo;Cour de Russie,&rdquo; some &ldquo;Angelo d&rsquo; Oro,&rdquo; or some
&ldquo;Schwarzen Adler,&rdquo; all alive with dusty arrivals and frogged couriers&mdash;the
very hall a fair, with fifty bells, all ringing; postboys blowing&mdash;whips
cracking&mdash;champagne corks flying&mdash;and a Bable of every tongue in
Europe, making a thorough-bass din that would sour a saint&rsquo;s temper!...
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ll leave at once&mdash;I&rsquo;ll find some quiet little gasthaus in the Tyrol
for a few weeks, till the weather moderates, and it becomes cool enough to
cross the Alps&mdash;and die!

<h2>
CHAPTER IX.
</h2>
<p>
These watering-place doctors have less tact than their <i>confrères</i>
elsewhere: their theory is, &ldquo;the Wells and Amusement;&rdquo; they never strain
their faculties to comprehend any class but that of hard-worked,
exhausted, men of the world, to whom the regularity of a Bad-ort, and the
simple pleasures it affords, are quite sufficient to relieve the load of
over-taxed minds and bodies. The &ldquo;distractions&rdquo; of these places suit such
people well; the freedom of intercourse, which even among our strait-laced
countrymen prevails, is pleasant. My Lord refreshes in the society of a
clever barrister, or an amusing essayist of the &ldquo;Quarterly.&rdquo; The latter
puts forth all his agreeability for the delectation of a grander audience
than he ever had at home. But to one who has seen all these ranks and
conditions of men&mdash;who finds nothing new in the <i>morgue</i> of the
Marquis, or the last <i>mot</i> of the Bench&mdash;it is somewhat too bad
to be told that such intercourse is a part of your treatment.
</p>
<p>
My worthy friend Dr. Guckhardt has mistaken me; he fancies my weariness is
the result of solitude, and that my exhaustion is but <i>ennui</i>; and,
in consequence, has he gone about on the high roads and public places
inquiring if any one knows Horace Templeton, who is &ldquo;sick and ill.&rdquo; And
here is the fruit: a table covered with visiting cards and scented notes
of inquiry. My Lord Tollington&mdash;a Lord of the Bedchamber, a dissolute
old fop&mdash;very amusing to very young men, but intolerable to all who
have seen anything themselves. Sir Harvey Clifford, a Yorkshire Jesuit,
who travels with a <i>socius</i> from Oscot and a whole library of tracts
controversial. Reginald St. John, a &ldquo;levanter&rdquo; from the Oaks. Colonel
Morgan O&rsquo;Shea, absent without leave for having shot his father-in-law.
Such are among the first I find. But whose writing is this?... I know the
hand well.... Frank Burton, that I knew so well at Oxford! Poor devil! he
joined the 9th Lancers when he came of age, and ran through every thing he
had in the world in three years. He married a Lady Mary somebody, and
lives now on her family. What is his note about?
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Dear Tempy,

&ldquo;I have just heard of your being here, and would have gone
over to see you, but have sprained my ancle in a hopping-
match with Kubetskoi&mdash;walked into him for two hundred,
nevertheless. Come and dine with us to-day at the France,
and we&rsquo;ll shew you some of the folk here. That old bore,
Lady Bellingham Blakely, is with us, and gives a pic-nic on
Saturday at the Waterfall&mdash;rare fun for you, who like a
field-day of regular quizzes! Don&rsquo;t fail&mdash;sharp seven&mdash;and
believe me,

&ldquo;Yours,

&ldquo;F. B.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
This requires but brief deliberation; and so, my dear Frank, you must
excuse my company, both at dinner and pic-nic. What an ass he must be to
suppose that a man of thirty has got no farther insight into the world,
and knows no more of its inhabitants, than a boy of eighteen! These
&ldquo;quizzes,&rdquo; doubtless, had been very amusing to me once&mdash;just as I
used to laugh at the &ldquo;School for Scandal&rdquo; the first fifty times I saw it;
but now that I have <i>épuisé les ridicules</i>&mdash;have seen every
manner of absurdity the law of Chancery leaves at large&mdash;why hammer
out the impression by repetition?
</p>
<p>
What is here by way of postscript?
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Lady B. has made the acquaintance of a certain Sicilian
Countess, the handsomest woman here, and has engaged her for
Saturday. If you be the man you used to be, you&rsquo;ll not fail
to come.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<hr />
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Dear F&mdash;&mdash;

&ldquo;I cannot dine out. I can neither eat, drink, nor talk, nor
can I support the heat or &lsquo;confaz&rsquo; of a dinner; but, if
permitted, will join your party on Saturday for half an
hour.

&ldquo;Yours truly,

&ldquo;H. Templeton.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Now has curiosity&mdash;I have no worthier name to bestow on it&mdash;got
the better of all my scruples and dislikes to such an agglomeration as a
pic-nic! Socially I know nothing so bad: the liberty is license, and the
license is an intolerable freedom, where only the underbred are at ease.
<i>N&rsquo;importe</i>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go; for while I now suspect that I was wrong
in believing the Countess to have been my old acquaintance, Caroline
Graham, I have a strange interest, at least, in seeing how one so like
her, externally, may resemble her in traits of mind and manner. And then
I&rsquo;ll leave Baden.
</p>
<p>
I am really impatient to get away. I feel&mdash;I suppose there is nothing
unusual in the feeling&mdash;that, as I meet acquaintances, I can read in
their looks those expressions of compassion and pity by which the sick are
admonished of their hopeless state; and for the very reason that I can
dare to look it steadily in the face myself, I have a strong repugnance to
its being forcibly placed before me. My greatest wish to live&mdash;if it
ever deserved the name of wish&mdash;is to see the upshot of certain
changes that time inevitably will bring out. I have watched the game in
some cases so closely, I should like to know who rises the winner.
</p>
<p>
What will become of France under a regency? How will the new government
turn the attention of the <i>mauvaises têtes</i>, and where will they
carry their arms? What will Austria do, when the Pope shall have given the
taste for free institutions, and the Italians fancy that they are strong
enough for self-government? What America, when the government of her newly
acquired territory must be a military dictation, with a standing army of
great strength? What Ireland, when the landlords, depressed by an
increasing poor-rate, have brought down the gentry to a condition of mere
subsistence, with Romanism hourly assuming a bolder, higher tone,
dictating its terms with the Minister, and treating the Government <i>de
pair?</i>
</p>
<p>
What Prussia, when democracy grows quicker when Constitutional Liberty,
and Freedom of the Press get ahead of the Censor?
</p>
<p>
For Belgium and Switzerland I have little interest. Priest-ridden and
mob-ridden, they may indulge their taste for domestic quarrel so long as a
general war is remote; let <i>that</i> come, and their small voices will
be lost in the louder din of far different elements.
</p>
<p>
As for the Peninsula, Spain and Portugal are in as miserable a plight as
free institutions combined with Popery can make them. If Romanism is to be
the religion of the State, let it be allied with Absolutism. The right to
think, read, and speak, are incompatible with the dictates of a Church
that forbids all three. Rome is the type. It is a grand and a stupendous
tyranny. <i>Gare!</i> to those who try to make it a popular rule!
</p>
<p>
So... I find that all Baden is full of our great picnic! Ours, I say, for
here lies Lady B&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s respectful compliments,
&amp;c, and my own replication is already delivered. It seems that we have
taken the true way to create popular interest, by trespassing on popular
enjoyment. We have engaged M. Gougon, the <i>chef</i> of the Cursaal;
engaged the band who usually perform before the promenade; engaged all the
saddle-horses, and most of the carriages&mdash;in fact, we have enlisted
every thing save the Genius Loci, the hump-backed croupier of the roulette
table.
</p>
<p>
Why we should travel twelve miles or so, out of our way, to bring Baden
with us I cannot so clearly see. Why we cannot be satisfied with vice
without a change of venue I do not understand. But with this I have
nothing to do. Like the Irishman, &ldquo;I am but a lodger.&rdquo; Indeed, I believe
my own poor presence was less desired at this <i>fête</i> than that of my
London phaeton and my two black ponies, which, I am told, are very much
admired here&mdash;a certain sign that they are not in the most correct
taste. However, I have my revenge. As Hussars, when invited to dine out at
questionable places, always appear in plain clothes, so shall I come to
the rendezvous in a <i>fiacre</i>; though, I own, it is very like
obtaining a dinner under false pretences.
</p>
<p>
Already the little town is a-stir; servants are hastening to and fro;
ominous-looking baskets and hampers are seen to pass and repass; strange
quadrupeds are led by as saddle-horses, their gay headstalls and splendid
saddle-cloths scarce diverting the eye from &ldquo;groggy&rdquo; fore-legs and
drawn-up quarters; curiously dressed young gentlemen, queer combinations
of Jockeyism with an Arcadian simplicity, stand in groups about; and, now
and then, a carriage rolls by, and disappears up some steep street in
search of its company.
</p>
<p>
Ah! there go the Tollingtons! and in a conveniency, too, they&rsquo;d scarcely
like to be seen with in Hyde Park. What a droll old rattle-trap! and what
a pair of wretched hacks to draw it! After all, one cannot help avowing
that these people, seated there in that most miserable equipage, where
poverty exhibits its most ludicrous of aspects, even there, they preserve
as decisive an air of class and rank as&mdash;as&mdash;yes, I have found
the exact equivalent&mdash;as almost every foreigner seated in a handsome
carriage does of the opposite. Prejudice, bigotry, narrow-mindedness, or
any thing else of the same kind it may be; but, after a great part of a
life spent abroad, my testimony is, that for one person of either sex,
whose appearance unmistakeably pronounces condition, met, abroad&mdash;I
care not where&mdash;at least one hundred are to be seen in England. So
much for the nation of shopkeepers!
</p>
<p>
Ah! a tandem, by Jove! and rather well got up. Of course it could be no
other than Burton&mdash;&ldquo;the ruling passion strong in &lsquo;debt!&rsquo;&rdquo; Well, he
may have forgotten his creditors, but he has not forgotten how to hold the
ribbons.
</p>
<p>
What&rsquo;s this heavy old coach with a cabriolet over the rumble?&mdash;the
Russian minister, Kataffsky! Lord bless us! from all the strong braces and
bars of wood and iron, one would say that it was built to stand a journey
to Siberia. Who knows, but it may travel that road yet!... Pretty woman
the Princess, but with all the characteristic knavery of her race in the
eyes. Paulwas right when he refused to license Jews in Russia, because he
knew his subjects would cheat <i>them!</i>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Bon jour, Marquis</i>.&rdquo; Monsieur de Tavanne, very absurd but a
chivalrous Frenchman of the old school. They say that, meeting the late
Duc d&rsquo;Orléans at Lady Grenville&rsquo;s, he took a very abrupt leave, expressing
as his reason that he did not know her Ladyship received &ldquo;<i>des gens
comme cela</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A Vienna <i>Coupé</i>, with a Vienna Coachman, and a Vienna Countess
inside, are very distinctive in their way. The Grafin von Lowenhaufen, one
of those pretty <i>intriguantes</i> of modern political warfare who
frequent watering-places and act as the tirailleurs for Metternich and
Guizot. Talleyrand avowed the great advantage of such assistance, which he
said was impossible for an English minister, for &ldquo;les Anglaises&rdquo; always
fell in love and blabbed!
</p>
<p>
Here comes a showy affair!&mdash;a real landau with four horses, as fine
as bouquets and worsted tassels can make them! No mistaking it&mdash;<i>Erin
go Brag!</i> Sir Roger M&rsquo;Causland and my lady, and the four Misses and the
Master M&rsquo;Causland. They are the invincibles of modern travel; they have
stormed every court in Europe, and are the terror of Grand Maréchals from
Naples to the Pole. Heaven help the English minister in whose city they
squat for a winter! He would have less trouble with a new tariff or a new
boundary than in arranging their squabbles with court functionaries and
the police. Sir Roger <i>must</i> know the King and his Ministers, and
expound to them his own notions of the government, with divers hints about
free trade and other like matters. My Lady <i>must</i> be invited to all
court balls and concerts, and a fair proportion of dinners; and this, &ldquo;<i>de
droit</i>,&rdquo; because &ldquo;the M&rsquo;Causland&rdquo; was a King of Ballyshandera in the
year 4, and my Lady herself being an O&rsquo;Dowde, also of blood royal. People
may laugh at these absurd, shameless pretensions, but &ldquo;<i>il rit le mieux,
qui rit le dernier</i>,&rdquo; says the proverb; and if the sentiment be one the
M&rsquo;Causlands&rsquo; dignity permit, they have the right to laugh heartily.
Boredom, actual boredom&mdash;a perseverance that is dead to all shame&mdash;a
persistance that no modesty rebukes&mdash;a steady resolve to push
forward, wins its way socially as well as strategically; and even the
folding-doors of court saloons fly open before its magic sésame.
</p>
<p>
And who are these gay equestrians with prancing hackneys, flowing plumes,
and flaunting habits?&mdash;The Fothergills; four handsome, dashing, <i>effronté</i>
girls, who, under the mock protection of a small schoolboy brother, are,
really, escorted by a group of moustached heroes, more than one of whom I
already recognise as scarcely fit company for the daughters of an English
church dignitary. <i>Mais que voulez-vous?</i> They would not visit the
curate&rsquo;s wife and sister in Durham, but they will ride out at Baden with
blacklegs and swindlers! The Count yonder, Monsieur de Mallenville, is a
noted character in Paris, and is always attended, when there, by an
emissary of the police, who, with what Alphonse Karr calls an <i>empressement
de bonne compagnie</i>, never leaves him for a moment.
</p>
<p>
And here we have the &ldquo;dons&rdquo; of the entertainment, la Princesse de
Rubetzki, as pretty a piece of devilry as ever Poland manufactured to sow
treason and disaffection, accompanied by her devoted admirer the Austrian
general, Count Cohary. Poor fellow! all his efforts to appear young and <i>volage</i>
are as nothing to the difficulties he endures in steering between the fair
Princess&rsquo;s politics and her affection. An Austrian of the &ldquo;<i>vieille
roche</i>&rdquo; he is shocked by the Liberalism of his lady-love; and yet, with
Spielberg before him, he cannot tear himself away.
</p>
<p>
They who are not acquainted with the world of the Continent may think it
strange that society, even in a watering-place, should assemble
individuals so different in rank and social position; but a very little
experience will always shew that intercourse is really as much denied
between such parties as though they were in different hemispheres. As the
Rhone rolls its muddy current through the blue waters of the Lake of
Geneva, and never mingles its turbid stream with the clear waves beside
it, so these people are seen pouring their flood through every assemblage,
and never disturbing the placid surface in their course. To effect this,
two requisites are indispensable to the company,&mdash;a very rigid
good-breeding and a very lax morality. No one can deny that both are
abundant.
</p>
<p>
And here, if I mistake not, comes my own <i>cher-à-banc</i>. Truly, my
excellent valet has followed my directions to the letter. I said,
&ldquo;Something of the commonest,&rdquo; and he has brought me a <i>fiacre</i> that
seems as moribund and creaky as myself. No matter, I am ready. And now to
be off!

<h2>
CHAPTER X.
</h2>
<p>
Now has there happened to me one of the strangest adventures of my strange
life, and before I sleep I have determined to note it down, for no other
reason than this: that my waking thoughts to-morrow will refuse to credit
mere memory, without some such corroboration. Nay, I have another witness&mdash;this
glove!
</p>
<p>
Were it not for this, I should have chronicled our <i>féte</i> which
really was far more successful than such things usually are. Not only was
there no <i>contretemps</i>, but all went off well and pleasantly. The men
were witty and good-tempered; the women&mdash;albeit many of them handsome&mdash;were
<i>aimable</i>, and disposed to be pleased; the weather and the champagne
were perfect. They who could eat&mdash;which I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;say, that
Gougon was admirable; and the band played some of Donizetti&rsquo;s pieces with
great precision and effect. <i>Ainsi</i>, the elements were all
favourable; each instrument filled its part; and the <i>ensemble</i> was
good&mdash;rather a rare event where people come out expressly bent on
enjoyment, and determined to take pleasure by storm. Premeditated
happiness, like marriage for love, is often too much premeditated. Here,
however, &ldquo;the gods were propitious.&rdquo; Unlike most picnics, there neither
was rain nor rancour; and considering that we had specimens of at least
half-a-dozen different nationalities, and frequently as many different
languages going at once, there was much amusing conversation, and a great
deal of pleasant, gossip-ping anecdote: not that regular story-telling
which depends upon its stage-effect of voice and manner, but that far more
agreeable kind of narrative that claims interest from being about people
and places that we know beforehand, conveying traits of character and mind
of well-known persons, always amusing and interesting.
</p>
<p>
There was a French secretary of legation for Berne, a most pleasant <i>convive</i>;
and the Austrian general was equally amusing. Some of his anecdotes of the
campaign of 1805 were admirable: by the way, he felt dreadfully shocked at
his own confession that he remembered Wagram. The Countess Giordani came
late. We were returning from our ramble among rocks and cliffs when she
appeared.
</p>
<p>
I did not wish to be presented; I preferred rather the part of observing
her, which acquaintance would have prevented. But old Lady B&mdash;&mdash;
did not give me the choice: she took my arm, and, after a little tour
through the company, came directly in front of the Countess, saying, with
a bluntness all her own,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Madame la Comtesse, let me present a friend whose long residence in your
country gives him almost the claim of a countryman:&mdash;M, Templeton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If I was not unmoved by the suddenness of this introduction&mdash;appealing
as it did, to me at least, to old memories&mdash;the Countess was
composure itself: a faint smile in acknowledgment of the speech, a gentle
expression of easy satisfaction on meeting one who had visited her
country, were all that even my prying curiosity could detect.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What part of Sicily have you seen?&rdquo; said she to me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My friend Lady B&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;has made me a greater traveller
than I can pretend to be: I have been no further south than Naples.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! I am not Neapolitan,&rdquo; said she, hastily, and with an air like
disappointment.
</p>
<p>
I watched her closely as she spoke, and at once said to myself, &ldquo;No! this
is not, this cannot be, Caroline Graham.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We conversed but little during dinner. She evidently did not speak French
willingly, and my Italian had been too long in rust for fluency. Of
English she shewed not the least knowledge. There were stories told in her
hearing, at some of which to avoid laughter would have been scarcely
possible, and still she never smiled once. If I wanted any additional
evidence that she was not of English origin, chance presented one, as she
was referred to by the Russian for the name of a certain Sicilian family
where a &ldquo;vendetta&rdquo; had been preserved for two entire centuries; and the
Countess replied, with a slight blush, &ldquo;The Marquis of Bianconetti&mdash;my
uncle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I own that, while it was with a sense of relief I learned to believe that
the Countess was not the sister of my poor friend, I still could not help
feeling something akin to disappointment at the discovery. I felt as
though I had been heaping up a store of care and anxiety around me for one
I had never seen before, and for whom I could really take no deep
interest. One husbands their affections as they grow older. The
spendthrift habit of caring for people without even knowing why, or asking
wherefore, which is one of the pastimes&mdash;and sometimes a right
pleasant one, too&mdash;of youth, becomes rarer as we go further on in
life, till at last we grow to be as grudging of our esteem as of our gold,
and lend neither, save on good interest and the best security. Bad health
has done for me the work of time, and I am already oppressed and weary of
the evils of age.
</p>
<p>
Something, perhaps, of this kind&mdash;some chagrin, too, that the
Countess was not my old acquaintance» though, Heaven knows, it had grieved
me far more to know she had been&mdash;some discontent with myself for
being discontented&mdash;or &ldquo;any other reason why,&rdquo;&mdash;but so was it, I
felt what in fashionable slang is called &ldquo;put out,&rdquo; and, in consequence,
resolved to leave the party and make my way homeward at the first
favourable opportunity. Before setting out I had determined, as the night
would be moonlit, to make a slight <i>détour</i>, and thus avoid all the
<i>fracas</i> and tumult of driving home in a mob; and, with this
intention, had ordered my phaeton to meet me in the Mourg-Thal, at a small
inn, whither I should repair on foot, and then make my tour back by the
Castle of Eberstein.
</p>
<p>
A move of the company to take coffee on a rock beside the Waterfall gave
me the opportunity I desired, and I sauntered along a little path which in
a few moments led me into the Pine Forest, and which, from the directions
I had received, I well knew conducted over the mountain, and descended by
a series of steep zigzags into the valley of the Mourg.
</p>
<p>
Although I had quitted the party long before sunset, the moon was high and
bright ere I reached the spot where my carriage awaited me. Exhilarated by
the unwonted exertion&mdash;half-gratified, too, by the consciousness of
supporting a degree of fatigue I had been pronounced incapable of,&mdash;I
took my seat in good spirits, to drive back to Baden. As I ascended the
steep road towards Eberstein, I observed that lights were gleaming from
the windows of the large salon of the castle, that looks towards the glen.
I knew that the Grand Ducal family were at Carlsruhe, and was therefore
somewhat surprised to see these signs of habitation in one of the state
apartments of the château.
</p>
<p>
Alternately catching glimpses of and again losing these bright lights, I
slowly toiled up the steep acclivity, which, to relieve my ponies, I
ascended on foot. We were near the top, the carriage had preceded me some
fifty yards or so, and I, alone, had reached a deeply-shaded spot, over
which an ancient outwork of the castle threw a broad shadow, when suddenly
I was startled by the sound of voices, so close beside me that I actually
turned to see if the speakers were not following me; nor was it till they
again spoke that I could believe that they were standing on the terrace
above me. If mere surprise at the unexpected sound of voices was my first
sensation, what was it to that which followed, as I heard a man&rsquo;s voice
say,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But how comes this M. Templeton to be of any consequence in the matter?
It is true he was a witness, but he has no interest in troubling himself
with the affair. He is an invalid besides&mdash;some say, dying.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would he were dead!&rdquo; interrupted a lower voice; but, although the accents
were uttered with an unusual force, I knew them&mdash;at once I recognised
them. It was the Countess spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why so, if he never recognised you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How am I certain of this?&rdquo; said she again. &ldquo;How shall I satisfy my own
fears, that at every instant are ready to betray me? I dread his reserve
more than all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he be so very inconvenient,&rdquo; interposed the man, in a half-careless
tone, &ldquo;there may surely be found means to induce him to leave this.
Invalids are often superstitious. Might not a civil intimation that his
health was suffering from his <i>séjour</i> incline him to depart?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Countess made no reply: possibly the bantering tone assumed by her
companion displeased her. After a brief silence, he resumed,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Does the man play? does he frequent the Saal? There surely are a hundred
ways to force a quarrel on him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Easier than terminate it with advantage,&rdquo; said she, bitterly.
</p>
<p>
I heard no more; for, although they still continued to speak, they had
descended from the terrace and entered the garden. I was alone. Before me,
at the turn of the road, stood my servant, waiting with the horses. All
was still as the grave. Was this I had heard real? were the words truly
spoken, or were they merely some trick of an overwrought, sickly
imagination! I moved into the middle of the road, so as to have a better
view of the old &ldquo;Schloss;&rdquo; but, except a single light in a remote tower,
all was shrouded in darkness: the salon, I believed to have been lit up,
lay in deepest shadow. There was nothing I had not given, at that instant,
to be able to resolve my doubts.
</p>
<p>
I walked hurriedly on, eager to question my servant both as to the voices
and the lights; and as I went my eye fell upon an object before me in the
road. I took it up&mdash;it was a glove&mdash;a lady&rsquo;s glove! How came it
there, if it had not fallen from the terrace?
</p>
<p>
With increased speed I moved forward, my convictions now strengthened by
this new testimony.
</p>
<p>
My servant had neither seen nor heard any thing; indeed his replies to me
were conveyed in a tone that shewed in what light he regarded my
questioning. It was scarcely possible that he could not have been struck
with the bright glare that illuminated a portion of the castle, yet he had
not seen it; and as to voices, he stoutly averred that, although he could
distinctly note the clatter of the mill in the valley below us, he had
heard no human sound since we left the little inn.
</p>
<p>
It was to no purpose that I questioned and cross-questioned. I soon saw
that my eagerness was mistaken by him for evidence of wandering faculties;
and I perceived, in his anxiety that I should return, a fear, that my
malady had taken some new turn. So far, too, was he right. My head was,
indeed, troubled&mdash;strange fancies and shadowy fears crossing my
excited mind as I went; so that, ere I reached my inn, I really was unable
to collect my faculties, and separate the dream-land from the actual
territory of fact. And now it is with painful effort I write these lines,
each moment doubting whether I should not erase this, or insert that. Were
it not for this glove, that lies on my paper before me, I should believe
all to be mere illusion. What a painful struggle this is, and how
impossible to allay the fears of self-deception! At one moment I am half
resolved to order a saddle-horse and return to Eberstein&mdash;for what?&mdash;with
what hope of unravelling the mystery? At the next I am determined to
repair to the Countess&rsquo;s villa near the town, and ask if she has returned;
but how shall I venture on such a liberty? If my ears had not deceived me,
she is and must be Caroline Graham; and yet would I not rather believe
that my weary brain had wandered, than that this were so?
</p>
<p>
But what are these sounds of voices in the antechamber? I hear Guckhardt&rsquo;s
voice!
</p>
<p>
Yes: my servant had thought it prudent to fetch the doctor, and he has
been here and felt my pulse, and ordered cold to my temples, and a calming
draught. It is clear, then, that I have been ill, and I must write no
more!

<h2>
CHAPTER XI.
</h2>
<h3>
Gasthaus, Zum Bär, Dallas, Tyrol.
</h3>
<p>
It is exactly seven weeks this day since I last opened my journal. I
promised Guckhardt not to look into it for a month, and so I have well
kept my word! It would seem, indeed, a small privation in most
circumstances to abstain from chronicling the ebbing hours of a life; but
Egotism is next of kin to Sickness, and I can vent mine more harmlessly
here than if spent in exhausting the patience of my friends. Some listener
must be found to the dreamy querulousness of the invalid, and why not his
own heart?
</p>
<p>
Even to those nearest and dearest to our affections, there is always a
sense of shame attendant on the confessions of our weakness, more so than
of our actual vices. But what a merciful judge is Self! how gentle to
rebuke! how reluctant to punish! how sanguine to hope for reformation!
Hence is it that I find a comfort in jotting down these &ldquo;mems&rdquo; of the
past; but from a friend, what shaking of the head, what regretful
sorrowings, should I meet with! How should I hear of faculties and fortune&mdash;life
itself&mdash;wasted without one object, even a wish, compassed! When I
reflect upon the position in life attainable by one who starts with
moderate abilities, a large fortune, reasonable habits of industry, and a
fair share of well-wishers, and then think of what I now am, I might
easily be discontented and dispirited; but if I had really reached the
goal, can I say that I should be happy? can I say, that all the success
within my reach could have stilled within me the tone of peaceful solitude
I have ever cherished as the greatest of blessings? But why speculate on
this? I never could have been highly successful. I have not the temper,
had I the talent, that climbs high. I must always have done my best <i>at
once</i>; put forth my whole strength on each occasion&mdash;husbanded
nothing, and consequently gained nothing.
</p>
<p>
Here I am at Dallas, in the Tyrol, a wild and lonely glen, with a deep and
rushing river foaming through it. The mountain in front of me is speckled
with wooden <i>chalets</i>, some of them perched on lofty cliffs, not
distinct from realms of never-melting snow.
</p>
<p>
All is poverty on every side; even in the little church, where Piety would
deck its shrine at any sacrifice, the altar is bare of ornament. The
Cure&rsquo;s house, too, is humble enough for him who is working yonder in his
garden, an old and white-haired man, too feeble and frail for such labour;
and already the sun has set, and now he ceases from his toil: for the
&ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; is ringing, and soon the village will be kneeling in prayer.
Already the bell has ceased, and through the stilly air rises the murmur
of many voices.
</p>
<p>
There was somewhat of compassionate pity in the look of the old man who
has just passed the window; he stopped a moment to gaze at me&mdash;at the
only one whose unbended knee and closed lips had no brotherhood in the
devotion. He seemed very poor, and old, and feeble, and yet he could look
with a sense of pity upon me, as an outcast from the faith. So did I feel
his steady stare at least; for, at that instant, the wish was nearest to
my heart that I, too, could have knelt and prayed with the rest. And why
could |I not? was it that my spirit was too stubborn, too proud, to mingle
with the humble throng? did I feel myself better, or nobler, or greater
than the meanest there, when uttering the same words of thankfulness or
hope? No, far from it; a very different, but not less powerful barrier
interposed. Education, habits of thought, prejudices, convictions, even
party spirit, had all combined to represent Romanism to my mind, in all
the glaring colours of its superstitions, its cruelties, and its
deceptions. Then arose before me a kind of vision of its tyranny over
mankind,&mdash;its inquisitions, its persecutions, its mock miracles, and
its real bloodshed; and I could not turn from the horrible picture, even
to the sight of those humble worshippers who knelt in all the sincerity of
belief.
</p>
<p>
I actually dreaded the sway of the devotional influence, lest, when my
heart had yielded to it, some chance interruption of ceremonial, some of
those fantastic forms of the Church, should turn my feelings of trust and
worship to one of infidelity and scorn.
</p>
<p>
There, all is over now, and the villagers are returning homewards&mdash;some,
to the little hamlet&mdash;others, are wending their way upwards, to homes
high amid the mountains&mdash;and here I sit alone, in my little
whitewashed room, watching the shadows as they deepen over the glen, and
gazing on that mountain peak that glows like a carbuncle in the setting
sun.
</p>
<p>
It is like a dream to me how I have come to sojourn in this peaceful
valley. The last entry I made was in Baden, the night of that party at the
Waterfall. The next day I awoke ill&mdash;fevered from a restless night.
Guckhardt came early, and thinking I was asleep, retired without speaking
to me. He laid his hand on my temples, and seemed to feel that I required
rest and quiet, for he cautioned my servant not to suffer the least
disturbance near me.
</p>
<p>
I conclude I must have been sleeping, for the sudden noise of voices and
the tramp of many feet aroused me. There was evidently something strange
and unexpected going forward in the town. What could it mean? My servant
seemed most unwilling to tell me, and only yielded to my positive commands
to speak.. Even now I tremble to recall the tidings&mdash;a murder had
been committed! One of the guests at our late <i>féte</i>, a young
Englishman named Lockwood, had been discovered dead on the side of the
road about two miles from the Waterfall; his watch, and purse with several
gold pieces, were found on his person, so that no robbery had been the
reason of the crime. I remember his having come on foot, and hearing that
I should not require my <i>char-à-banc</i> to return, he engaged it. The
driver&rsquo;s story is, that the stranger always got out to walk at the hills,
usually lingering slowly in his ascent of them; and that at last, at the
top of the highest, he had waited for a considerable time without his
appearing, and growing weary of expectancy he returned, and at the foot of
the hill discovered something dark, lying motionless beside the pathway;
he came closer, and saw it was the stranger quite dead. Three wounds,
which from their depth and direction seemed to have been given by a
dagger, were found in the chest; one, entered from the back between the
shoulders; the fingers of the right hand were also cut nearly through, as
though he had grasped a sharp weapon in his struggle. Death must have been
immediate, as the heart was twice wounded; probably he expired almost at
once. The direction and the position of the wounds refuted every idea of a
suicide&mdash;and yet how account for the crime of murder? The stranger
was scarcely a week in Baden, not known to any one before his arrival
here, and since had merely formed those chance acquaintanceships of
watering-places. There was not, so far as one could see, the slightest
ground to suspect any malice or hatred towards him.. The few particulars I
have here set down were all that my servant could tell me. But what from
the terrible nature of the tidings themselves, my own excitable state when
hearing them, but, more than either, the remembrance of the dialogue I had
overheard the night before&mdash;all combined and increased my fever to
that degree that ere noon I became half wild with delirium. What I said,
or how my wandering faculties turned, I cannot&mdash;nor would I willingly&mdash;remember.
There was enough of illness in my ravings, and of method in them too, to
bring Guckhardt again to my bedside, accompanied by a high agent of the
police. The attempt to examine a man in such a state relative to the
circumstances of a dreadful crime could only have entered the head of a <i>Préfet
de Police</i> or a <i>Juge d&rsquo;Instruction</i>. What my revelations were I
know not; but it is clear they assumed a character of independent fancy
that balked the scrutiny of the official, for he left me to the unmixed
cares of my doctor.
</p>
<p>
By his counsel I was speedily removed from Baden, under the impression
that the scene would be prejudicial to my recovery. I was indifferent
where, or in what way, they disposed of me; and when I was told I was to
try the air of the Lake of Constance, I heard it with the apathy of one
sunk in a trance. Nor do I yet know by what means the police, so
indefatigable in tormenting the innocent, abandoned their persecution of
me. They must have had their own sufficient reasons for it; so much is
certain.
</p>
<p>
And now, once more, I ask myself, Is all that I have here set down the
mere wanderings of a broken and disjointed brain? have these incidents no
other foundation than a morbid fancy? I would most willingly accept even
this sad alternative, and have it so; but here is evidence too strong to
disbelieve. Here before me lies an English newspaper, with a paragraph
alluding to the mysterious murder of an English gentleman at Baden. The
dates, circumstances, all tally in the minutest particulars. Shall I
discredit these proofs?
</p>
<p>
The Countess is married to the Marquis de Courcelles; a distant relative
of the Archduchess, it is said. Let me dismiss the theme for ever&mdash;that
is, if I can. And now for one whose interest to me is scarcely less sad,
but of a very different shade of sadness.
</p>
<p>
This is my birthday, the 31st August. &ldquo;Why had the month more than thirty
days?&rdquo; is a question I have been tempted to hazard more than once. Nor is
it from ingratitude that I say this. I have long enjoyed the easy path in
life; I have tasted far more of the bright, and seen less of the shady
side of this world&rsquo;s high-road than falls to the share of most men. With
fortune more than sufficient to supply all that I could care for, I have
had, without any pretension to high talent, that kind of readiness that is
often mistaken for ability; and, what is probably even more successful
with the world, I have had a keen appreciation of talent in other men&mdash;a
thorough value for their superior attainments; and this&mdash;no great
gift, to be sure&mdash;has always procured me acceptance in circles where
my own pretensions would have proved feeble supporters. And then, this
delicacy of health&mdash;what many would have called my heaviest calamity&mdash;has
often carried me triumphantly through difficulties where I must have
succumbed. Even in &ldquo;the House&rdquo; have I heard the prognostications of what I
might have been, &ldquo;if my health permitted;&rdquo; so that my weak point
ministered to me what strength had denied me.
</p>
<p>
Then, I have the most intense relish for the life of idleness I have been
leading; the lounging &ldquo;do-nothingism&rdquo; that would kill most men with <i>ennui</i>,
is to me inexpressibly delightful. All those castle-buildings which, in
the real world, are failures, succeed admirably in imagination. I overcome
competitors, I convince opponents, I conciliate enemies at will, so long
as they are all of my own making; and so far from falling back
disappointed from the vision, to the fact, I revel in the conviction that
I can go to work again at new fancies; and that, in such struggles, there
is neither weariness nor defeat. A small world for ambition to range in!
but I value it as Touchstone did his mistress,&mdash;&ldquo;a poor thing, but it
was mine own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It would be a strange record if a man were to chronicle his birthdays,
keeping faithful note of his changed and changing nature as years stole
on. For myself I have always regarded them somewhat like post-stations in
a journey, ever expecting to find better horses and smoother roads next
stage, and constantly promising myself to be more equable in temperament
and more disposed to enjoy my tour. But the journey of life, like all
other journeys, puts to flight the most matured philosophy, and the
accidents of the way are always ready to divert the mind from its firmest
resolves.
</p>
<p>
Tuesday Morning, When I had written so far last night, the arrival of a
travelling carriage and four, with a Courier preceding, caused such a
commotion in the little inn that, notwithstanding all my assumed
indifference, I could not entirely escape the contagion, and, at last, was
fain to open my window and stare at the new arrival with all the hardihood
that becomes him already in possession of an apartment. &ldquo;I took little by
my motion.&rdquo; All I saw was a portly travelling carriage, heavily laden with
its appurtenances and imperials, well-corded springs, rope-lashed pole,
and double drag-chains,&mdash;evidences of caution and signs of
long-projected travel.
</p>
<p>
I might have readily forgotten the new comer&mdash;indeed, I had almost
done so ere I closed the window&mdash;had not his memory been preserved
for me by a process peculiar to small and unfrequented inns,&mdash;a
species of absorption by which the traveller of higher pretensions
invariably draws in all the stray articles of comfort scattered through
the establishment. First my table took flight, and in its place a small
and ricketty thing of white deal had arrived; next followed a
dressing-glass; then waddled forth a fat, unwieldy, old arm-chair, that
seemed by its difficulty of removal to have strong objections to
locomotion; and lastly, a chest of drawers set out on its travels, but so
stoutly did it resist, that it was not captured without the loss of two
legs, while every drawer was thrown out upon the floor, to the manifest
detriment of the waiter&rsquo;s shins and ankles. These &ldquo;distraints&rdquo; I bore well
and equably, and it was only a summary demand to surrender a little sofa
on which I lay that at length roused me from my apathy, and I positively
demurred, asking, I suppose, querulously enough, who it was that required
the whole accommodation of the inn, and could spare nothing for another
traveller? An &ldquo;English Prince&rdquo; was the answer; at which I could not help
laughing, well knowing that the title is tolerably indiscriminate in its
application. Indeed, I once heard Colonel Sibthorp called such.
</p>
<p>
It is all very well to affect indifference and apathy, to pretend that you
care nothing who or what your neighbour in an inn may be. This is very
practicable where his identity takes no more corporeal shape than No. 42
or 53 in some great overgrown hôtel. But imagine yourself in some small
secluded spot, some little nook, of which you had half fancied you were
the first discoverer&mdash;conceiving yourself a kind of new Pérouse;
fancy, then, when in the very ecstasy of your adventure, the arrival of a
travelling carriage and four, with a belted Courier and a bearded Valet;
not only are your visions routed, but your own identity begins to dissolve
away with them. You are neither a hero to yourself nor to &ldquo;mine host.&rdquo; His
best smiles, his deepest reverence, are now for the last comer, for whose
accommodation a general tribute is levied. Do what you will, say what you
will, there is no remaining deaf to the incessant turmoil that bespeaks
the great man&rsquo;s wants. There is a perpetual hurry-scurry to seek this and
fetch that; soda-water&mdash;tea&mdash;champagne&mdash;a fire&mdash;hot
water&mdash;are continually echoing along the corridor, and &ldquo;the Prince&rdquo;
 seems like some vast &ldquo;Maelstrom&rdquo; that all the larder and the cellar
contain can never satiate. Such, certainly, the least exacting of men
appear when under the auspices of a Courier and the host of a small inn.
</p>
<p>
The poverty of the establishment makes the commonest requirements seem the
demand of a Sybarite indulgence, and every-day wants are luxuries where
cleanliness is the highest of virtues.
</p>
<p>
I was&mdash;I own it&mdash;worried and vexed by the clamour and movement,
that not even coming night calmed down. The repose and quiet I had been so
fully enjoying were gone, and, in their place, the vulgar noises and
tumult of a little inn. All these interruptions, intimately associated in
my mind with the traveller, invested him, to me, with a character
perfectly detestable, so that there was somewhat of open defiance in my
refusal to yield up my sofa.
</p>
<p>
A pause followed. What was to come next? I listened and waited in half
anxiety, wondering what new aggression might ensue; but all was still:
nay, there was a clattering of knives and forks, and then went the pop of
a cork&mdash;&ldquo;the Prince&rdquo; was eating. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;there is some
vengeance here, for the <i>cuisine</i> is detestable.&rdquo; &ldquo;His Highness&rdquo;
 thought so too, for more than one <i>plat</i> was dismissed, accompanied
by a running commentary of abuse on the part of the Courier.
</p>
<p>
At last came a really tranquil moment. The cheese had been sent away as
uneatable, and the Courier had followed it, cursing manfully, if I might
pronounce from the odour wafted to my own chamber, not unreasonably. &ldquo;Mi
Lor le Prince&rdquo; was probably composing himself to a siesta; there was a
stealthy quietude in the step of his servant along the corridor that said
so much. I had scarcely made the reflection when a tap came to my door.
&ldquo;The Prince&rdquo; wished for an English newspaper, and the host had seen two on
my table. The &ldquo;Post&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Chronicle&rdquo; were both before me, and I sent
them, half wondering which best might suit his Highness&rsquo;s politics.
</p>
<p>
Another tap at the door! Really this is intolerable. Has he not had my
table, my arm-chair, my newspapers&mdash;what will he ask for next? &ldquo;Come
in,&rdquo; said I, now trying English, after in vain shouting &ldquo;Entrez&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Herein&rdquo; three times over.
</p>
<p>
An English servant entered, and in that peculiarly low, demure tone, so
distinctive of his caste, said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sir Robert Chawuth presents his compliments, and begs to know if he may
pay his respects to Mr. Templeton?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is Sir Robert here? is that his carriage?&rdquo; said I, hastily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; he came about an hour ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very well. Say, I shall feel great pleasure in seeing him. Is he
disengaged at present?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, he is quite alone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shew me his apartment, then.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; thought I, as I arose to seek the chamber, &ldquo;this time they were
nearer right than usual; for, if not an &lsquo;English Prince,&rsquo; he has wielded
more substantial power, and exerted a much wider sway over the destinies
of the world, than ever a &lsquo;foreign Prince&rsquo; from the Baltic to the
Bosphorus.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Strange enough, our last meeting was at Downing Street; he was then
Minister. I waited upon him by appointment, as I was leaving England for
the Prussian mission, and <i>he</i> desired to give me his own
instructions before I sailed; and now, I visit him in a little Tyrol
&ldquo;Gasthaus,&rdquo; he, destitute of power, and myself&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<hr />
<p>
It would be presumptuous in one so humbly placed to hazard an opinion on
the subject; but if I were to dare it, I should say that the statesmen of
England possess a range of knowledge and a wider intimacy with the actual
condition of the world as it is than any other class, in any country. I
was greatly struck with this last evening. The topics wandered far
a-field, varying from the Poor Laws to Hong Kong, from the Health of Towns
to the state of the Peninsula: Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, the
Navigation Laws, the policy of Louis Philippe, and the rot in the
potatoes; and on each of these themes he not only spoke well, but he spoke
with a degree of knowledge that smacked of a special study. &ldquo;How comes
it,&rdquo; I asked myself, &ldquo;that this man, with the weighty cares of a mighty
empire on his brain, has time to hear and memory to retain little traits
of various people in remote quarters of the world? How, for instance, did
he hear, or why remember, these anecdotes of the present Landamman of
Switzerland, Ochsenbein?&rdquo; And yet there were good reasons perhaps, to
remember them. The man who has personally shewn the white feather will
scarcely be courageous as the head of a government, though there is great
reason to suspect that he may exhibit all the rashness of cowardice&mdash;its
worst, because its most dangerous, quality.
</p>
<p>
I had often suspected, but I never knew before, how completely this
Minister had usurped every department of the Cabinet, and concentrated in
himself the Home, the Foreign, and the Colonial Governments. The very
patronage, too, he had assumed; so that, in fact, his colleagues were
comparatively without influence or occupation. I confess that, on hearing
him talk so unconcernedly of mighty events and portentous changes, of
great interests and powerful states, that my heart beat strongly with an
ambitious ardour, and a feverish throbbing of my temples suggested to me
that the longing for rank, and station, and power, had not yet died away
within me. Was it with serious intention that he spoke to me of again
entering Parliament and taking office in some future arrangement, or was
it merely from a sense of compassion that he ministered this meed of
encouragement to the hopes of a sick man? Whatever the motive, the result
has been an increased buoyancy, more of vitality about me, than I have
known for some time&mdash;a secret wishing for life and strength to &ldquo;do
something&rdquo; ere I die.
</p>
<p>
He rather appeared pleased with a suggestion I threw out for augmenting
the elective franchise in Ireland, by making the qualification &ldquo;an
intellectual one,&rdquo; and extending the right of voting to all who should
take a certain degree or diploma in either the University of Dublin or any
of the provincial colleges, all admitted as members of learned bodies, and
all licentiates of law and physic. This would particularly suit the
condition of Ireland, where property is a most inadequate and limited
test, and at the same time, by an infusion of educated and thinking men
into the mass, serve to counterbalance and even guide the opinions of
those less capable of forming judgments. We are becoming more democratic
every day. Let our trust be in well-informed, clearsighted democracy, and
let the transition be from the aristocracy to the cultivated middle
classes, and not to the rule of Feargus O&rsquo;Connor and his Chartists.
</p>
<p>
And now, to wander down this lonely glen, and forget, if I may, these
jarring questions, where men&rsquo;s passions and ambitions have more at stake
than human happiness. Do what I will, think of what I will, the image of&mdash;Caroline
Graham&mdash;yes, I must call her so, rises before me at every step. It is
a sad condition of the nervous system when slight impressions cut deep.
Like the diseased state of the mucous membrane, when tastes and odours
cling and adhere to it for days long, I suppose that the prevalence of
such images in the brain would at last lead to insanity, or, at least,
that form of it called Monomania. Let no man suppose that this is so very
rare a malady. Let us rather ask, Who is quite free from some feature of
the affection? The mild cases are the passionate ardour we see exhibited
by men in the various and peculiar pursuits in life; the bad ones, only
greater in degree, are shut up in asylums.
</p>
<p>
The most singular instance that ever occurred within my own knowledge was
one I met several years back in Germany; and as &ldquo;thereby hangs a tale,&rdquo; I
will set it down in the words of the relator. This is his own recital&mdash;in
his own handwriting too!
</p>
<p>
There are moments in the life of almost every man which seem like years.
The mind, suddenly calling up the memory of bygone days, lives over the
early hours of childhood&mdash;the bright visions of youth, when all was
promise and anticipation&mdash;and traverses with a bound the ripe years
of manhood, with all their struggles, and cares, and disappointments; and
even throws a glance into the dark vista of the future, computing the &ldquo;to
come&rdquo; from the past; and, at such times as these, one feels that he is
already old, and that years have gone over him.
</p>
<p>
Such were to me the few brief moments in which I stood upon the Meissner
hill that overhangs my native city. Dresden, the home of my childhood, of
my earliest and my dearest friends, lay bathed in the soft moonlight of a
summer&rsquo;s eve. There, rose the ample dome of the cathedral in all the
majesty of its splendid arch, the golden tracery glittering with the night
dew; here, wound the placid Elbe, its thousand eddies through purple and
blushing vineyards, its fair surface flashing into momentary brilliancy,
as the ripples broke upon the buttresses of that graceful bridge, long
accounted the most beautiful in Europe; while from the boat that lay
sleeping upon its shadow came the rich tones of some manly voices, bearing
to my ear the evening hymn of my fatherland! Oh, how strong within the
heart of the wanderer in distant lands is the love of country!&mdash;how
deeply rooted amid all the feelings which the cares and trials of
after-life scatter to the wind! It lives on, bringing to our old age the
only touch and trace of the bright and verdant feelings of our youth. And
oh, how doubly strong this love, when it comes teeming with a flood of
long-forgotten scenes&mdash;the memory of our first, best friends&mdash;the
haunts of our boyhood&mdash;the feats of youthful daring&mdash;and, far
more than all, the recollection of that happy home, around whose hearth we
met with but looks of kindness and affection, where our sorrows were
soothed, our joys shared in! For me, &lsquo;tis true, there remained nought of
this. The parents who loved me had gone to their dark homes&mdash;the
friends of my childhood had doubtless forgotten me. Years of absence had
left me but the scenes of past happiness&mdash;the actors were gone. And
thus it was as I looked down upon the city of my native land. The hour
which in solitude and lowness of heart I had longed and prayed for had at
length arrived&mdash;that hour which I believed in my heart would repay me
for all the struggles, the cares, the miseries of fourteen years of exile;
and now I stood upon that self-same spot where I had turned to take a
farewell look of my native city, which I was leaving poor, unfriended, and
unknown, to seek in Italy those opportunities my forlorn condition had
denied to me at home. Years of toil and anxiety had followed; the evils of
poverty had fallen on me; one by one the cheerful thoughts and bright
fancies of youth deserted me; yet still I struggled on, unshaken in
courage. The thought of one day returning to my loved Saxon land, rich in
reputation, crowned with success, had sustained and upheld me. And now
that hour was come&mdash;my earliest hopes more than realised&mdash;my
fondest aspirations accomplished. Triumphant over all the difficulties of
my hard lot, I returned, bearing with me the well-won spoils of labour and
exertion. But, alas! where were they who should rejoice with me, and share
my happiness? The very home of my infancy was tenanted by strangers; they
knew me not in my poverty, they could not sympathise in my elevation. My
heart sickened within me as I thought of my lone and desolate condition;
and as the tears coursed fast and faster down my cheeks, how gladly would
I have given all the proud triumph of success for one short and sunny hour
of boyhood&rsquo;s bright anticipation, shared in by those who loved me!
</p>
<p>
Oh! how well were it for us if the bright visions of happiness our
imaginations picture forth should ever recede as we advance, and,
mirage-like, evade us as we follow! and that we might go down to the grave
still thinking that the &ldquo;morrow&rdquo; would accomplish the hopes of to-day&mdash;as
the Indian follows the phantom-bark, ever pursuing, never reaching. The
misery of hope deferred never equalled the anguish of expectation
gratified, only to ascertain how vain was our prospect of happiness from
the long-cherished desire, and how far short reality ever falls of the
bright colouring hope lends to our imaginings. In such a frame of deep
despondency I re-entered my native city&mdash;no friend to greet, no voice
to welcome me.
</p>
<p>
Happily, however, I was not long left to the indulgence of such regrets;
for no sooner was my arrival made known in the city, than my brother
artists waited on me with congratulations; and I learned, for the first
time, that the reputation of my successes had reached Saxony, and that my
very best picture was at that moment being exhibited in the Dresden
Gallery. I was now invited to the houses of the great, and even
distinguished by marks of my sovereign&rsquo;s favour. If I walked the streets,
I heard my name whispered as I passed; if I appeared in public, some burst
of approbation greeted me. In a word, and that ere many days had elapsed,
I became the reigning favourite of a city in which the love of &ldquo;art&rdquo; is an
inheritance: for, possessed of a gallery second to none in Europe, the
Dresdeners have long enjoyed and profited by the opportunity of
contemplating all that is excellent in painting; and, in their
enthusiastic admiration of the fine arts, thought no praise too exalted to
bestow on one who had asserted the claim of a Saxon painter among the
schools of Italy.
</p>
<p>
To the full and unmeasured intoxication of the flattery that beset me on
every side, I now abandoned myself. At first, indeed, I did so as a relief
from the sorrowful and depressing feelings my unfriended solitude
suggested; and at last, as the passion crept in upon and grasped my very
heart-strings, the love of praise took entire possession of my being, and
in a short time the desire for admiration had so completely supplanted
every other emotion, that I only lived with enjoyment when surrounded by
flattery; and those praises which before I heard with diffidence and
distrust, I now looked for as my desert, and claimed as my right. The
&ldquo;spoiled child of fortune,&rdquo; my life was one round of gaiety and
excitement, For <i>me</i>, and for my amusement, <i>fêtes</i> were given,
parties contrived, and entertainments planned, and the charmed circle of
royalty was even deserted to frequent the places at which I was expected.
</p>
<p>
From these circumstances it may readily be believed how completely I was
beset by the temptations of flattery, and how recklessly I hurried along
that career of good fortune which, in my mad infatuation, t deemed would
last for ever. I saw my name enrolled among the great ones of my art&mdash;myself
the friend of the exalted in rank and great in wealth&mdash;my very
praise, patronage. Little knew I that such sudden popularity is often as
fleeting as it is captivating, that the mass of those who admire and are
ever loudest in their praises are alike indifferent to, and ignorant of,
art. Led along by fashion alone, they seemed delighted, because it was the
rage to appear so. They visited, because my society was courted by others;
and if their knowledge was less their plaudits were louder than those of
the discriminating few, whose caution and reserve seemed to me the
offspring of jealousy and envy.
</p>
<p>
It is well known to almost all, how, in the society of large cities, some
new source of interest or excitement is eagerly sought after to enliven
the dull routine of nightly dissipation, and awaken the palled and jaded
appetite of pleasure to some new thrill of amusement!&mdash;how one
succeeds another, and how short-lived are all! The idol of to-day is
forgotten to-morrow; and whether the object of momentary attraction be a
benefactor of mankind, or some monster of moral deformity, it matters but
little, so that for the hour he furnish an article for the fashionable
journalist, and a subject of conversation to the <i>coterie</i>; the end
and aim of his being seems to be perfectly accomplished, and all interest
for him as readily transferred to his successor, who or whatever he may
be, as though his existence had been as unreal as the spectre of a magic
lantern.
</p>
<p>
Little did I suppose when, in the full blaze of my popularity, that to
such an ordinance of fashion alone I was indebted for the proud eminence I
occupied. I was not long destined to enjoy the deception.
</p>
<p>
It chanced that about three months after my arrival in Dresden,
circumstances required my absence from the city for a few days. The
occasion which called me detained me beyond the time I had calculated on,
and it was not till after a fortnight I reached my home. I had travelled
that day from sunrise till late in the evening, being anxious, if
possible, to redeem a promise I had made to my friend and patron, Count
Lowenstein, to be present at a <i>fête</i> in honour of his sister&rsquo;s
birthday. The weather had been unusually hot and sultry, even for the
season; and although I felt much fatigued and jaded, I lost not a moment
on my arrival to dress for the <i>fête</i>, over which, calculating on my
late career, I deemed my absence would throw a gloom. Besides that, I
longed once more to drink of that Circean cup of flattery, for which my
short absence from the city had given me new zest; and it was with a
high-beating heart and fevered brain I hung upon my breast the many
crosses and decorations I had been gifted with in my hours of brilliant
success.
</p>
<p>
Lights gleamed brightly from the ample windows of the Lowenstéin palace.
Numerous equipages stood at the portico. I followed the chasseur up the
spacious marble steps which led to the ante-chamber. I stopped one moment
before a large mirror, and almost startled at the brilliancy of my dress,
which, a present from my sovereign, I now wore for the first time. With a
high-swelling heart and bounding step&mdash;for all fatigue was long since
forgotten&mdash;I approached the door; and oh! the throb with which I
heard my name now, for the first time, announced with the title of
&ldquo;Baron,&rdquo; which his Majesty had conferred upon me the day of my departure!
That name, which alone had, talisman-like, opened for me the doors of all
who were illustrious and exalted in rank&mdash;that name, which heard,
silenced the hum of voices, to break forth the moment after in accents of
praise and welcome! Again it rung through the crowded salon, and I stood
within the door. Formerly, when appearing in society, the moment I made my
<i>entrée</i> I found myself the centre of a group of friends and
admirers, all eagerly pressing forward to pay their homage to the star of
fashion. Now, what was my amazement to mark no thrill of pleasure, as of
old, animate that vast assembly!&mdash;not even surprise! group after
group passed by me, as though I were unknown, and had no claim to their
attention. It is true, I heard some friendly voices and kind inquiries;
but I could neither distinguish the words nor the speaker. My brain was in
a whirl; for, alas! long since had I learned to care less for the language
of affection than the voice of the flatterer. I stood thunderstruck and
amazed; and it was some minutes before I could, with any appearance of
composure, reply to the salutations I met with. Something must have
occurred in my absence to weaken the interest my appearance ever excited;&mdash;but
what could that be? And the assembly, too! had my own baffled hopes lent
their gloomy colouring to all around? I certainly thought it far less
brilliant than usual; a sad and depressing influence seemed to pervade all
the guests, which they appeared vainly to struggle against. Tortured with
doubt and disappointment, I hastened through the crowd to where the Count
was standing, surrounded by his suite. His quick eye instantly perceived
me, and, familiarly kissing his hand to me, he continued to converse with
those about him. Up to this moment I had borne all the chilling
indifference of manner I met with, from the secret satisfaction that told
me in my heart that he, my protector, my friend, would soon vindicate my
claim to notice and distinction, and that, in the sunshine of his favour,
I should soon receive the attention my heart thirsted for. But now that
hope deserted me, the cold distance of his manner chilled me to the very
heart&rsquo;s core* Not one word of kind inquiry, no friendly chiding for
protracted absence, no warm welcome for my coming! I looked around on
every side for some clue to this strange mystery; I felt as if all eyes
were upon me, and thought for a moment I could perceive the sneer of
gratified malice at my downfall. But no: I was unnoticed and unobserved;
and even this hurt me still more. Alas! alas! the few moments of
heart-cutting, humbling misery I then endured, too dearly paid for all the
selfish gratification I reaped from being the idol of fashion. While I
remained thus the Count approached me, and, with something like his usual
tone of familiarity, said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Carl!&mdash;you here? You have, of course, heard of our sad
disappointment?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; I replied, with some bitterness of tone, &ldquo;I have scarcely
had time, for I have not been yet an hour in Dresden.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Without noticing either the manner of my answer or the allusion to my
absence, the Count continued,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This evening we were to have had the happiness to have amongst us one who
seems to be gifted with some magic power of diffusing delight and ecstasy
on every side where she appears. Those whose hearts were cold to beauty in
all others, have yielded to the fascination of hers; and the soul that
never before was touched by melody has thrilled with transport at her
heavenly voice. Divine La Mercia! the paragon of beauty and the soul of
song! There, there stands her harp, and here you see her music; but she is
absent. Alas! we have only the wand of the magician&mdash;the spell is not
there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In an instant the veil was lifted from my eyes; the whole truth burst on
me like a lightning flash&mdash;the course of my popularity was run, the
sun of my favour had set for ever.
</p>
<p>
The fatigue of my journey, the heat of the salon, the confusion of my
mind, and the bitter conflict of my feelings, all conspired to unman me,
and I sank upon a sofa. As I sat thus unnoticed (for the tone of the
Count&rsquo;s manner had divested the few who were previously attentive of all
interest for me), I overheard the conversation of those around me. But one
name was mentioned, but one person seemed to engross every tongue or heart&mdash;that
was La Mercia.
</p>
<p>
From what I could collect it appeared that she, a most beautiful and
interesting girl, had appeared at the Opera a few evenings since, and by
the charms of her surpassing beauty, as well as the surprising richness
and clearness of her voice, had captivated the whole city, from the palace
to the cottage. The enthusiastic repetition of her praises gradually led
to regrets for her absence, and surmises as to the cause, while a young
nobleman, who had just joined the circle, said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Trust me, La Mercia would have come if <i>she</i> alone were consulted;
but I fear that ill-tempered looking old fellow, whom she calls her
‘Dottore,&rsquo; has had much to say to this refusal.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;so late as yesterday evening, at the palace, when
she was surrounded by several members of the royal family, eagerly
pressing her to repeat a song she had just sung,&mdash;just as she
consented, a look from the &lsquo;Dottore&rsquo; shot across the room and met her
eyes; she immediately hesitated, begged to be permitted not to sing, and
immediately afterwards withdrew.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; said the nobleman who spoke before, &ldquo;how very strange! It
was but a few nights since, at the Opera, I witnessed the deference and
submission with which she addressed him, and the cold indifference with
which he met looks and heard tones that, would have made another&rsquo;s heart
beat beyond his bosom. It must, indeed, be a strange mystery that unites
two beings so every way unlike;&mdash;one all beauty and loveliness, and
the other the most sarcastic, treacherous-looking wretch, ever my eyes
beheld.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The deep interest with which I listened to those particulars of my rival&mdash;for
such I now felt her to be&mdash;gradually yielded to a sense of my own
sunken and degraded condition; and envy, the most baleful and pernicious
passion that can agitate the bosom, took entire possession of me: envy of
one whose very existence one hour before I was ignorant of. I felt that <i>she&mdash;she</i>
had injured me,&mdash;robbed me of all for which life and existence was
dear. But for <i>her</i>, I should still be the centre of this gay and
brilliant assembly, by whom I am already forgotten and neglected: and,
with a fiendish malignity, I thought how soon this new idol of a fickle
and ungrateful people would fall from the pinnacle from which she had
displaced me, and suffer in her own heart the cruel pangs I was then
enduring.
</p>
<p>
I arose from where I had been sitting, my brain maddened with my sudden
reverse of fortune, and fled from the salon to my home* In an agony of
grief I threw myself upon my bed, and that night was to me like years of
sorrowing and affliction.
</p>
<p>
When morning broke, my first resolve was to leave Dresden for ever; my
next to remain, until, by applying all my energies to the task, I had
accomplished something beyond all my former efforts; and then, spurning
the praise and flattery my success would inspire, take a proud farewell of
my fickle and ungrateful countrymen. The longer I thought upon, the more
was I pleased with, this latter resolution, and panted with eagerness for
the moment of contemptuous disdain, in which, flinging off the caresses of
false friends, I should carry to other lands those talents which my own
was unworthy to possess. It was but a few days before this the Prior of
the Augustine monastery had called upon me, to beg I would paint an
altar-piece for their chapel: they wished to have a kneeling figure of
Mary, to whom the shrine was dedicated; but the subject, being a favourite
one of Titian&rsquo;s, had at that time deterred me. Its difficulty was now its
charm; and as I pondered over in my mind the features I wished to transfer
to my canvass, I suddenly remembered a painting which I had had for some
years in my possession, and which, from the surpassing loveliness of the
countenance it represented, as well as the beauty of its execution, had
long fascinated me. I now reverted to it at once, and opening a secret
drawer in my cabinet, took out the picture and placed it before me. It was
a small and most beautifully painted enamel, representing two figures&mdash;one
that of an old and stern-visaged man, upon whose harsh and severe features
there played a scowl of deadly hate and scorn: he stood, drawn up to his
full height, his hands and arms widely extended before him, as if in the
act of performing some mystic or sacred rite over the lovely being who
knelt at his feet in an attitude of the deepest and most reverential
supplication. This was a lovely girl, her age scarcely eighteen years: her
forehead, fair as alabaster, was shaded by two braids of dark brown hair,
which hung back in heavy locks upon her neck and shoulders. Her eyes, of
the deepest blue, were upraised and tearful, and the parted lips seemed
almost to utter a murmured prayer, as her heaving bosom told some inward
anguish; her hands were firmly clasped, but the arms hung powerless before
her, and the whole figure conveyed the most perfect abandonment to grief
it was possible to conceive. Here were the features, here the very
attitude, I desired. Could I only succeed in imparting to my Madonna the
lovely and sorrow-struck countenance before me, my triumph were certain. I
had walked every gallery of Europe, from one end to the other; I had
visited every private collection where a good picture was to be found, yet
never had I beheld the same magic power of conveying, in one single scene,
so much of storied interest as this small picture displayed. The features
of that beautiful girl, too, bad the semblance of being copied from the
life. There are certain slight and indescribable traits by which a painter
will, in almost every case, distinguish when nature and when only fancy
have lent the subject; and here, every thing tended to make me believe it
to be a portrait. The manner in which I became possessed of it, also,
contributed to invest it with a more than common interest in my eyes. The
circumstances were these:&mdash;When a very young man, and only a short
time settled at Rome, whither I had gone to prosecute my studies as a
painter, the slender state of my purse had compelled me to take up my
residence in one of the less known suburbs of the city. In the same humble
dwelling in which I took up my abode there lived an old and paralytic man,
whom age and infirmity had rendered bed-ridden for years. At first, my
occupation being entirely without doors, left me but little opportunity to
see or know much of him; but when winter closed in, and confined me whole
days to the house, my acquaintance with him gradually increased, and, to
my great surprise, I discovered in this poverty-struck and decrepid old
man one who possessed the most intimate and critical knowledge of art;
every gallery was familiar to him&mdash;he knew the history of each
celebrated picture, and distinguished originals from their copies by such
traits of discernment as evinced the most consummate intimacy with the
deepest secrets of colouring, and, in a word, shewed himself to be, what I
afterwards learned he was, a most accomplished artist: but the
circumstances which threw him into his present mean and wretched condition
ever remained a mystery. Various little acts of kindness and attention,
which I had in my power to bestow, seemed to make a great impression on
him, while my own friendless and solitary situation drew me into closer
intimacy with one who seemed to have fewer of this world&rsquo;s comforts than
myself. To him, therefore, I confided all the circumstances which led me
to Rome&mdash;my ardent desire for distinction&mdash;my longing for
eminence in art: while he, by his advice and counsel, which he was well
qualified to afford, directed my studies and encouraged my efforts.
</p>
<p>
Our acquaintance thus formed, rapidly ripened into friendship, and it was
with pleasure I hurried from my gayer and more volatile companions to the
poor and humble abode, where my old and feeble friend awaited me with
impatience.
</p>
<p>
As the winter advanced, the infirmities of the old painter rapidly gained
ground; he became daily weaker, and, by degrees, the calm serenity of his
mind, which was his most remarkable trait, yielded to fits of impatience,
in which, sometimes, his very reason seemed to struggle for empire: and at
such times as these he would drop hints, and give vent to thoughts, that
were awful and appalling to listen to. It appeared to me that he regarded
his present afflicted state as the dreadful retribution of some real or
imaginary crime; for, in addition to the unceasing depression which seized
him, his fears of death were incessant, and great beyond measure*
Sometimes, the thought that there was no future state would shoot across
his mind, and a species of reckless gaiety would follow; but in a moment
after, the strong and full conviction of his self-deception would visit
him&mdash;and then his agony was frightful to witness. In the sad
alternation of these states of hope and fear, in which the former was, if
possible, more affecting to witness, weeks rolled on. One night when
recovering from a nervous attack, which, by its duration and severity
seemed to threaten more fatally than usual, he called me to him, and
desired me to bring, from a concealed drawer in his trunk, a small ebony
box clasped with silver. I did so. He took it with trembling hands, and
placed it beside him on the pillow, while, with a voice scarcely audible
from agitation, he whispered:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Leave me, Carl&mdash;leave me to myself! There is in this box what may
meet no other eye than mine. And oh! would to Heaven that its bright
lightnings had struck and blighted me, rather than I should ever have
looked upon it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The energy with which these words were spoken seemed to weary and overcome
him, and he was barely able to say:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Leave me now, my friend. But stay: ere you go, promise me&mdash;swear to
me, as you hope&mdash;ay, as you hope your death-bed may be not like mine&mdash;swear,
when all is at rest within this torn and afflicted heart, that you will,
with your own hands, place this box within my coffin,&mdash;swear to place
it there unopened: better far you had not enjoyed the blessed gift of
sight, than look upon what it contains. I grow weaker,&mdash;promise me
this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; I replied hurriedly. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Swear it,&rdquo; he said; while the large drops of sweat stood upon his brow,
and his bloodshot eyes glared upon me like a maniac.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I swear,&rdquo; said I, anxious to relieve the terrific convulsion which his
eagerness brought on; &ldquo;I swear.&rdquo; And as he lay back slowly upon the bed, I
left the room.
</p>
<p>
When again, after a considerable time, I entered the chamber, he had
turned his face towards the wall&mdash;his head buried between both his
hands; while sobs, which he appeared struggling to control, burst from him
at intervals. The casket lay locked beside him. I took it up, and placed
it within my portmanteau; and, not daring to interfere with the course of
that sorrow, the cause of which he had not confided to me, I stole
noiselessly from the room.
</p>
<p>
When next I saw him he appeared to be somewhat better; but the feeble
powers of life had received a severe shock, and his haggard and broken
look shewed how much a few hours had hastened the approach of death. That
evening he never once alluded to the subject which had agitated him, and
bade me &ldquo;Good night&rdquo; earlier than usual, wishing to relieve his fatigue by
sleep.&mdash;I never saw him after.
</p>
<p>
I had scarcely composed myself to sleep, my mind full of the events of the
day, when an express arrived from an English nobleman, who had been my
most influential and steadiest friend, requiring me immediately to set out
for Naples, to make a picture of his only daughter ere her body was
committed to the earth. She had died of the malaria, and her funeral could
not be long delayed. I immediately set out, taking with me the portmanteau
that contained the casket, and such requisites for painting as I could
hurriedly collect. With all my anxiety to return to my old companion, I
was unable to leave Naples before the tenth day; I then turned my face
homewards, with a heart beating with anxiety, lest his death should have
taken place in my absence. The diligence in which I travelled was attacked
near Calvi by Banditti. Several of the passengers, being well armed, made
resistance, and a dreadful conflict took place. Severely wounded in the
side with a stiletto, I remained for dead upon the ground, and lost all
remembrance of every thing till the moment I discovered myself a patient
in the public hospital of Naples.
</p>
<p>
Several weeks of fever and delirium had passed over me, and I lay now weak
and powerless. By degrees my strength was restored, and as I lay, one day,
meditating a speedy departure from the hospital, the intendant of the
police came to inform me that several articles of value, contained in a
portmanteau bearing my initials, had been discovered near the scene of the
late encounter, where they had probably been dropped by the robbers in
their flight, and that, on my identifying and claiming them as mine they
should be restored to me. Among other things he mentioned the ebony
casket.
</p>
<p>
I dared not ask if it were opened, lest my agitation might occasion
surprise or suspicion, and promised to inspect them the following morning,
and identify such as were my property.
</p>
<p>
The next day I appeared at the bureau of the police. The portmanteau was
produced and unlocked, and the very first thing I set my eyes upon was the
picture. The case had been rudely torn open, and it lay there exposed to
all. My promise&mdash;my solemnly pledged oath, came instantly to my mind,
and all the awful denunciations the old man had spoken of, as in store for
him who should look upon that picture! I was horror-struck and speechless,
and only remembered where I was, as the <i>Commissaire</i>, who stood
behind me and looked at it, asked if I were the painter? I replied not.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The likeness is, indeed, wonderful,&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
I started; but immediately recovering myself, said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must be under some mistake. You could scarcely have seen the person
for whom this was intended?&rdquo; I said this because, from the attentive
consideration I had given it, as well as the initials in the corner of the
drapery, I perceived it to be one of the most beautifully executed enamels
of Julio Romano, and must, at least, have been nearly two centuries old.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Impossible I can be mistaken!&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;that is not only the Comtess
d&rsquo;Alvini herself, but there, and even more like, stands her uncle, &lsquo;Il
Dottore Albretto,&rsquo; as he was called. Why, I remember as well as though it
were but yesterday, though I was only a boy at the time, her marriage&mdash;with
one of your own profession, too. How can I forget his name!&mdash;ah, I
have it&mdash;Antonio Gioventa! By the by, they said, too, the union was
none of the happiest, and that they separated soon after. But of that I
know nothing myself, for they never appeared in Naples after the morning
they were married.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
How I longed to make one or two inquiries! but fear prevented me;&mdash;fear
lest my own ignorance concerning the history of the picture might be
discovered, and I confess, too, something like dread; for, the evident age
of the picture tallied but ill with the account the <i>Commissaire</i>
gave of the characters represented; and I longed for the moment I should
put into execution, at least, so much of my promise as was yet in my
power: putting it up, therefore, with such of my effects as I recognised,
I returned to my hôtel.
</p>
<p>
The entire evening I could think of nothing but the story of the <i>Commissaire</i>.
The artist could have been none other than my old friend Nichola Calertio&mdash;for
by this name I had known him,&mdash;and that lovely creature must have
been his wife! And what was her fate? and what could have been the awful
mystery that wrapt their history? These thoughts dwelt in my mind, and,
framing ten thousand solutions of the secret, I at last sunk into sleep.
</p>
<p>
The following day I took my departure for Rome. On my arrival, what was my
horror to discover that Nichola had died the day after my departure from
Naples, and that he had been buried in the strangers&rsquo; burial-ground; but
in what spot, no one knew&mdash;nor had he one left who could point out
his grave. Again my oath came to my mind, and I could not divest myself of
the thought, that in the series of events which prevented its
accomplishment chance had nothing to do; and that the hand of a guiding
Providence had worked these apparent accidents for His own wise ends.
</p>
<p>
From that hour I guarded, how closely I cannot say, this picture from all
human eye; but if I did so, the very impulse which drove me to conceal it
from all others led me to look upon it myself. Like the miser who
possesses a hidden treasure, ten thousand times dearer that it is known to
him alone, I have sat, hour by hour, in the silent contemplation of it in
my chamber; I have studied the features one by one, till I almost thought
the figure lived and breathed before me; and often have I left the crowded
and brilliant salon to seek, in the stillness of my own home, the
delicious calm and dreamy tranquillity that painting ever inspired me
with.
</p>
<p>
And so it had been my custom, when first I returned to Dresden, to sit for
days long with that picture open before me. As a work of art, it possessed
undoubted excellence; but I could not help feeling that its mysterious
history had invested it with an interest altogether deeper and more
powerful than the beauty of the execution could alone account for. This
habit had been first broken in upon by the numerous and varied occupations
my newly-arisen popularity brought upon me; and amid the labours of the
painting-room, and the gay hours of fashionable dissipation, I had been
now some weeks without once having seen it, when the events I have just
detailed, and my determination to copy from it, brought it again fully to
my mind.
</p>
<p>
The day which followed that long night of misery passed I know not how.
When I awoke from the deep musing my thoughts had fallen into, it was
already evening: the sun had set, and a soft twilight was sleeping on all
around. I opened my window, and let the cool breeze of the evening blow
upon my heated and fevered brain; and as I sat thus, lost in reverie, the
last traces of daylight gradually faded away, and a thin, crescent-like
moon, shewed itself over the hill of the Meissner. The city lay in deep
shadow, and almost in silence; the mournful plashing of the river being
plainly heard above all other sounds. There is something sad, and almost
awful, in the sight of a large and populous city bathed in the silence and
sleep of night; its busy voice hushed, its streets untrodden, or echoing
to the tread of a solitary passer-by. To me this was now most welcome. The
dreamy melancholy of my mind felt pleasure in the death-like stillness
about me, and I wandered forth to enjoy the free air and balmy breeze upon
the bank of the Elbe. After some time I crossed the bridge, and continued
my walk through the suburb, intending to return by a beautiful garden
which lies on that side of the river. As I approached the Elbe I was
struck by the bright glare of light which, proceeding from some building
near, illuminated the river nearly the whole way across, displaying upon
its glassy surface several boats, in which the people sat resting on their
oars, and scarcely moving in the gentle tide of the stream. I remembered
for a moment, and then it occurred to me that the brilliant glare of light
proceeded from the villa of Count Lowenstein, which stood upon a small
promontory of land, about two miles from Dresden, this being the night of
a private <i>soiree</i>, to which only his nearest and most intimate
friends were ever invited. Report had spoken loudly of the singular beauty
of the villa itself, the splendour of its decorations, the richness and
taste of its furniture; and, indeed, around the whole character of the
place, and the nature of the entertainments held there, the difficulty of
<i>entrée</i>, and the secrecy observed by the initiated, had thrown an
air of the most romantic interest. To these <i>soirées</i> although
honoured by marks of the greatest distinction, and even admitted to the
closest intimacy, the Count never invited me, and in the days of my
prosperity it had ever been with a sense of pique I called to mind the
circumstance. Thither I now inadvertently bent my steps, and it was only
when the narrowness of the path which lay between the hedge of the garden
and the river required my caution in walking, that I remembered I must
have entered the grounds, and was then actually within a few paces of the
villa. While I stood for a moment, uncertain whether to retreat or
advance, I was struck by observing that the boats had gradually and
noiselessly approached the bank, a short way from where I was, and, by the
attitudes of the figures I could perceive that they were listening most
eagerly and attentively. I approached a few steps, till, at the sudden
turning of the walk, I found myself beneath the terrace of a splendid
salon, brilliantly lighted, and crowded by numerous and full-dressed
guests. The rarest plants and most beautiful exotics stood in jars along
the balustrade, diffusing their perfume around, and the cheerful hum of
voices was heard in the still night air as parties walked to and fro upon
the balcony. Suddenly the din of voices was hushed, those that were
walking stood still, as if spell-bound,&mdash;a few seconds of the most
perfect silence followed&mdash;then two or three chords of a harp, lightly
but tastefully struck,&mdash;and then flowed forth a burst of melody, so
full, so rich, so swelling, in the recitative of Rossini, &ldquo;Oh, Patria!&mdash;oh,
dolce ingrata Patria!&rdquo;&mdash;that it filled my heart with transport, and
my eyes with tears; and to my wounded and broken spirit there came a holy
and delicious calm, as if by some magic spell another had divined my
inward sorrow, and, in giving it expression, had given it relief.
</p>
<p>
The recitative over, oh with what triumphant gladness came the brilliant
<i>aria</i>, diffusing joy and happiness through every fibre of my frame!
and, as one delicious cadence succeeded another, I felt my heart beat
strong and stronger against my side. My sorrow&mdash;my deep, depressing
sorrow&mdash;was forgotten; a very heaven of brilliant hopes was opened
before me, and peace flowed in upon my soul once more. The singer paused;
then came a melting cadence, followed by a thrilling shake&mdash;so low,
so plaintive, and so clear, I felt as if the last emotion of happiness
fled with it. A silence of a moment followed, and then a thunder of
applause flowed in on every side; and the words, &ldquo;<i>Divine La Mercia!</i>&rdquo;
 burst from every voice around.
</p>
<p>
I stood amazed and thunderstruck. The quick transition of my feelings had
completely overpowered me, and I was only aroused by hearing a voice so
near me as to startle me. It was the Count who spoke: he stood directly
above me, leaning against a pillar of the portico, and supported upon his
arm a lady, but, from her position, I could not catch her features. From
his soft, low, and earnest tone of voice, it was plain the nature of his
suit was one of heartfelt interest; while the few words she spoke in
answer, from their soft tones and foreign accent, left me no doubt they
came from La Mercia. I crept nearer the balcony, and, concealed behind the
balustrades, waited anxiously to catch a glance at her as she passed. The
light fell strongly from an open window upon this part of the terrace; and
I could perceive, as she came forward, that, disengaging herself from the
Count&rsquo;s arm, she assumed a more gay and lively manner. She was now within
a few feet of where I stood eagerly waiting for the moment she would turn
to enter the salon. She curtsied deeply to some persons in the crowd; and
ere I could recover from the effect of the graceful and beautiful attitude
she assumed, she turned. Merciful Heaven! could it be true? I almost
screamed aloud, and, but for the hold I took of the balcony, should have
fallen. The picture was La Mercia: the same calm brow, the same melting
look, that beautiful outline of neck and throat, and, above all, that
lovely contour of head, to see which once was never to forget. She was
gone! the guests disappeared one by one from the terrace, the salon became
again crowded, and the windows were closed against the now chilling night
air; and yet so suddenly all seemed to happen, I could scarcely believe
but that still that lovely voice and beauteous form were before me; and I
could not help thinking, as I left the spot, that to an excited brain and
fevered imagination the likeness of the picture to La Mercia must have
been owing, as with slow steps I retraced my way homeward.
</p>
<p>
The next morning early I left Dresden for the Augustine monastery at
Tetchen, and ardently commenced the intended altar-piece; but, fearing
lest the likeness to La Mercia might have been real, I did not copy from
the painting as I had resolved. For three months I laboured unceasingly;
and, whether from the perfect occupation of my time, or that the peaceful
and tranquil life of the holy men with whom I lived had its influence, I
know not, but my mind once more regained its calmness and serenity, and I
felt almost happy again.
</p>
<p>
In this frame of mind I was, when, one morning, one of the fathers,
entering my apartment, informed me that my old friend and patron, Count
Lowenstein, was about to be married. I started, and hurriedly asked to
whom, while the deep blush which suffused my cheek told too plainly the
interest I took in the answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said the monk; &ldquo;but report speaks of her as eminently
beautiful.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you recognise the name if you heard it?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have heard it but once, but think I might remember it again,&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then it is La Mercia,&rdquo; I replied.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The same&mdash;La Mercia was the name; and they say a more splendid
wedding Dresden has never witnessed than this will be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I cannot explain why, but never did I feel, at any period of my life, so
completely overcome as when I listened to this report. Never before had I
confessed to myself how I had felt towards La Mercia, nor even now could I
tell: it was not love; I had never seen her but for a few brief seconds,
and yet in my heart she lived, the guiding-star of all my thoughts and
aspirations; and though my most sanguine dreams never anticipated my
calling her mine, yet I could not bear the thought that she was to belong
to another. I resolved at once to set out for Dresden, and, if possible,
see her once before the wedding would take place. I thought it would he a
balm to my feelings should I look upon her, before she was lost to me for
ever, and I longed ardently to trace, with what calmness I was able, how
far the likeness with the picture was real or imaginary. With these
intentions I left the monastery that evening, and returned to Dresden.
</p>
<p>
When I reached home I learned that the Count had been married, and found
upon my table a most pressing invitation from him to his <i>soirée</i> at
the villa that evening. At first I resolved not to accept it. The full
measure of my loneliness had never so pressed on me before; for although,
in reality, La Mercia was not, nor could ever have been, aught to me, yet
I felt as if my fate and happiness were, by some inexplicable ties, wound
up with hers; and now that tie was to be broken. I had begun to believe
that the extraordinary impression she had made upon my mind had entirely
suggested the resemblance with the picture, which some chance trait of
likeness might have contributed to, and I longed ardently to see her;&mdash;but
then, to see her the bride of another! These conflicting thoughts agitated
me during the entire day, and I knew not what to decide on.
</p>
<p>
When evening came I embarked upon the Elbe, and, after a half-hour&rsquo;s
rowing, reached the villa of the Count. Lights gleamed from every window,
and delicious music was borne on the night wind, that blew gently along
the river. Numerous servants, in gorgeous liveries, passed and repassed
along the spacious veranda, which ran the entire length of the building,
carrying fruit, wine, and ices to those who preferred the balmy air and
starry sky without, to the heat and glitter of the crowded salon within.
</p>
<p>
With difficulty I made my way through the dense mass that filled the
antechamber, and at length reached one of the reception-rooms, scarcely
less crowded. On every side I beheld some of the highest persons of the
city: groups of officers in splendid uniforms, ambassadors glittering in
orders and crosses, distinguished foreigners, artists, authors, were all
mingled together in thick profusion, enjoying the magnificence and
splendour which unbounded wealth, guided and directed by the most
cultivated taste, could create. Standing in mute admiration of a beautiful
figure of Psyche, which seemed fresh from the chisel of Canova, I was
roused by a voice addressing me, while at the same moment my shoulder was
gently tapped. I turned;&mdash;it was the Count himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur le Baron,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Enfin après un an!</i>&rsquo; as Racine
has it. Where have you buried yourself and all your agreeability these
ages past? But come, I shall not tax your invention for excuses and
apologies; follow me&mdash;the Countess has heard me frequently speak of
you, and longs to make your acquaintance. This way&mdash;after me as well
as you can.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The friendly tone of the Count, as well as its being almost the first time
of my being addressed by my new title, brought a deep blush to my cheek,
which fortunately was unobserved as I followed him in the crowd. He passed
through this room to one still larger, filled with parties playing at
several small tables, and thence into an oval salon, where waltzing was
going on. With great difficulty we got through this, and arrived at a
curtain of white cloth, fringed at the bottom with deep and massive silver
lace; this he drew gently aside, and we entered the boudoir. Upon a small
ottoman, over which was thrown a rich Persian shawl, sat the Countess.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Isadora,&rdquo; said the Count, as he approached&mdash;&ldquo;Isadora, &lsquo;<i>carissima
mia</i>,&rsquo; this is my friend, Carl Stelling.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She lifted her head from the picture she was shewing to a lady beside her,
and as her eye beamed fully upon me and her lips parted to address me, I
fell fainting to the ground.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is!&mdash;it is!&rdquo; I muttered, as the last ray of consciousness was
leaving my whirling brain.
</p>
<p>
When I recovered, the Count was standing over me bathing my temples. I
looked wildly around. I saw we were still in the boudoir, although all but
one or two had departed; and from the window, now opened, there came a
cool and refreshing breeze. I looked anxiously around for the Countess:
she stood at a table, her cheek deadly pale, and I thought her appearance
evinced great agitation. I heard her, in a low whisper, ask,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I immediately recovered myself sufficiently to say, that, overcome by the
heat of the salon, in my then weak state, that I felt completely
overpowered. But I saw my explanation seemed incomplete, and that some
words must have fallen from me which I did not remember.
</p>
<p>
The Count, at the same instant, putting his lips to my ear, said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Carl, this must be explained at another and more fitting moment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This increased my agitation, for I now perceived that my merely being
taken suddenly ill could never have given rise to such a feeling as all
around seemed to labour under. Before, then, I could at all determine how
to act, the Countess approached me, and, in her softest and kindest
manner, asked if I were better.
</p>
<p>
In a moment all my agitation was forgotten; and, indeed, every one of the
party seemed to participate, as if by magic, in the balmy influence her
few words shed around. Conversation soon resumed its course. For some time
the Count&rsquo;s manner was constrained and uncertain, but that soon wore away,
as the joyous tone and sparkling gaiety of his lovely bride seemed to have
their effect upon every one about her; and even I&mdash;torn, as I was, by
feelings I could neither trace nor divine&mdash;felt under the mystic
spell that so much beauty and grace diffused on every side. With a
wonderful tact she alluded at once to such subjects that compelled me, as
an artist, to speak, and speak warmly; and, seemingly, catching the
enthusiasm from me that she herself had created, she spoke of Venice&mdash;its
thousand recollections&mdash;its treasures of art&mdash;its rich
historical associations&mdash;its ancient glory; and then, taking up her
guitar, played with such tenderness and feeling one of the well-known
gondolier <i>canzonette</i>, as made the very tears stand in my eyes.
</p>
<p>
The victory was complete: I forgot the past&mdash;I knew no longer where I
was. A bright Elysium of bliss had opened before me; and even now, after
years of such misery as few have known, I could say that one hour of such
intoxicating happiness would be, almost, cheaply bought by even such
affliction.
</p>
<p>
I started from my trance of pleasure on observing that the guests were
taking leave. I at once arose, and, as she extended her hand to me, I felt
the blood rush to my face and forehead. I barely dared to touch it with my
lips, and retired. I hurried from the villa, and, springing into my boat,
was soon landed at the bridge of Dresden.
</p>
<p>
From that time my visits at the villa were frequent; seldom a week elapsed
without my receiving one or two invitations from the Count; and, at last,
to such an extent did my intimacy proceed, and so superior in attraction
was the society there, that for it I deserted all other, and only felt
happy when with my kind patrons. During this, by far the most delightful
period of my life, I was not entirely free from unhappiness. Sometimes the
likeness of the Countess to the picture would appear to me so striking as
not to be mistaken: one day particularly, when some sudden intelligence
was brought to her that caused momentary alarm for the Count&rsquo;s safety, her
pale cheek and quivering lip brought the portrait so perfectly before me,
that I was unable to speak or offer her advice when she asked my opinion;
and then, vague and horrid doubts, and a dread of some unknown and
unforeseen calamity, would flash upon my mind; and those who have
experienced how deeply they can be impressed by a presentiment of evil,
can tell how little it is in their power to rally their spirits against
terrors which take every or any shape. And while I reasoned with myself
against what might be mere groundless fear, yet I never could look upon
the picture and call to mind the death-bed sorrow of the old artist,
without feeling that some dreadful fate was connected with its history, in
which, as its mere possessor, I might be involved. Sometimes to such a
degree did this anxiety prevail upon me, that I had fully determined to
shew it to the Countess, and either endeavour to trace its history from
her, or at once rid myself of all apprehension concerning it, if she
disclaimed all knowledge of it; but then, if she really were connected
with its story&mdash;if, as it was possible, a mother&rsquo;s fate (for the
resemblance could warrant such a relationship) were wound up&rsquo; with the
story,&mdash;what right had I, or how could I answer to myself, for the
mere satisfaction of my own doubts, to renew the sorrows, and, perhaps,
even be the means of publishing to the world the sad detail of forgotten
crime or misfortune? Perhaps, however, the picture was not, as I supposed,
an antique: it might be an admirable copy. But this idea was relinquished
at once: the more I examined, the more fully did it corroborate my opinion
of its being the work of a master. Such thoughts as these&mdash;and they
grew upon me daily more and more&mdash;embittered the happiest moments of
my intercourse with my friends; and often, when the merry laugh and the
joyous glee which pervaded our parties at the villa were at the highest, I
thought of that picture, and my heart sank at the recollection, and I
would hasten to my home to conceal from every eye the terror and anguish
these thoughts ever inspired me with.
</p>
<p>
One evening when dressing for the Count&rsquo;s villa I received a <i>billet</i>,
written in pencil and evidently in haste; it came from himself, and
informed me that the Countess, who had that morning made a short excursion
upon the river, had returned home so ill that the entertainment was
deferred. I was, however, requested to call the following morning, to take
some sketches of Pirna from the villa, which I had long since promised to
make for them. So completely had I withdrawn myself from all other society
during my great intimacy with Count Lowenstein, that I now felt the <i>billet</i>
I received left me unable to say where or how I should pass my evening.
</p>
<p>
In this uncertainty I wandered forth, and without thinking whither my
steps led me, it was only on hearing the boatman ask if I were ready, that
I perceived I had strolled to the steps beside the bridge, where I usually
took my departure for the villa. Lost in reverie and led captive by habit,
I had walked to this spot unconsciously to myself.
</p>
<p>
I was about to dismiss the boatmen for the night, when a whim seized me to
drop on board and visit those small and wooded islands that lie about a
league up the river. It was a calm and beautiful night; and in the wild
and untrodden solitude of these romantic islands I remained till near
midnight.
</p>
<p>
As we passed the grounds of the Count, I or-dered the boatmen to land me
at a spot remote from the house, whence I could proceed on foot, wishing
to make some inquiry for the Countess before I returned home. They
accordingly put me on shore at a small flight of steps which descended to
the water&rsquo;s edge, from a terraced path that ran a considerable distance
through the park, and was concealed in its entire length by tall hedges of
beech, completely overgrown with flowering creeping shrubs, and so
impenetrable, that, even in noon-day, it was impossible for those without,
to see persons walking within, while the closely-shaven sod effectually
prevented footsteps being heard. The moon was up, and nearly at the full,
and all beneath me in the richly-ornamented flower-garden was bathed in a
sea of mellow light. The marble statues that adorned the walks threw their
lengthened shadows at their bases, while their own whiteness seemed purer
and fairer than ever. The villa itself, half obscured by trees, seemed, in
its tranquil beauty, the very emblem of peace; and as the pillars of the
portico threw a deeper shadow, gave a broadness to the effect which struck
me as wonderfully beautiful. I gazed around me with momentarily increasing
admiration. The gentle murmuring of the leaves agitated by the breeze, and
the plash of the river, made the silence around me even more striking. I
stood lost in the enjoyment of the delicious repose of the whole scene,
when a slight noise upon the gravel walk attracted my attention; I
listened, and now distinctly heard footsteps approaching, and also the
voices of persons whispering in a low and much-suppressed tone. They came
nearer, and were now only concealed from my view by the tall hedge,
beneath which they walked; and soon the shadow of two figures were cast
along the broad walk in the bright moonlight. For a moment they stopped
speaking, and then I heard a laugh, in a low and under tone&mdash;but such
a laugh! My very blood ran chilled back upon my heart as I heard it. Oh,
if the fiend himself had given that dreadful and heart-appalling laugh, it
could not be more awful! It scarcely died away in the faint echo, ere I
heard the sobs, deep and low, of another and far different voice. At this
instant the figures emerged from the darkness and stood in the bright
moonlight. They stood beside an old and broken pillar, which had once
supported a sun-dial, and around whose shaft the clustering ivy had wound
itself. They were entirely concealed by large cloaks which enveloped their
entire figures, but still I could perceive that one was much larger and
more robust than the other. This latter taking a small lamp, which was
concealed beneath the folds of his cloak, placed it upon the pillar, while
at the same instant the other figure, throwing off the cloak, knelt at his
feet. Oh, that reason had left me, or that life itself had parted from me,
ere I should look upon that scene! She&mdash;she who knelt and held her
suppliant hands was La Mercia; and he who, now divested of his mantle,
stood over her, was the dark and awful-looking man of the picture! There
they stood. The dresses of both were copied to the life; their looks&mdash;oh,
Heaven! their very looks were pictured as they stood. She spoke: and as
she did so, her arms fell powerless before her; he scowled the same horrid
scowl of hate and scorn. My brain was turning; I tried to scream out, my
voice failed me&mdash;I was mute and powerless; my knees rocked and smote
each other; convulsive tremor shook me to the centre, and with a groan of
agony I sank fainting to the earth.
</p>
<p>
The day was breaking ere I came to myself; I arose, all was quiet around
me. I walked to the boat&mdash;the boatmen were sleeping; I awoke them,
and we returned to Dresden. I threw myself upon my bed&mdash;my brain
seemed stupified and exhausted&mdash;I fell into a profound sleep, and
woke not till late the following evening. A messenger had brought a note
from the Count&mdash;&ldquo;The Countess is worse.&rdquo; The note detailed briefly
that she had passed a feverish and disturbed night, and that the medical
attendants had never left the villa. Was it then but a dream, my dreadful
vision of the past night? and had my mind, sorrowing for the affliction of
my best friend, conjured up the awful scenes I believed to have witnessed?
How could it be otherwise? The <i>billet</i> I received told most
distinctly that she was confined to her bed, severely, dangerously ill;
and of course watched with all the care and attention the most sedulous
anxiety could confer. I opened the picture, and then conviction flashed
with lightning&rsquo;s rapidity upon me, that it was not delusion&mdash;that no
dream had brought these images before my mind. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;my friend,
my patron, how have I betrayed thee? Why did I not earlier communicate the
dreadful story of the picture, and thus guard you against the machinations
by which the fiend himself has surrounded you? But then, what had I to
tell? how embody the vague and shadowy doubts that took, even in my own
mind, no palpable shape or form?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
That entire day was passed in alternate resolution and abandonment; now,
determined to hasten to the villa, and disclose to the Count every
circumstance I had seen, and then thinking how little such mere suspicion
would gain credence, and how unfit the present moment to obtrude upon his
breaking and distracted heart the horrid dread that haunted mine. Towards
evening a messenger arrived, breathless with haste. He brought no note,
but merely bade me hasten to the villa, as the Count wished to see me with
all possible despatch. I mounted the servant&rsquo;s horse, and in a few minutes
reached the place. Servants were running hither and thither distractedly.
I asked, eagerly, How was the Countess? No one could tell, but all seemed
to imply that there was no hope of recovery. I entered the large spacious
and hall, and threw myself upon a sofa; and as I looked around upon the
splendid hangings, the gilded cornices, and marbled pillars, and thought
upon that sorrow such splendour surrounded, my heart sickened. A shadow
fell upon the brightly polished floor. I looked up&mdash;a figure stood at
the window of the hall, and stared me steadily in the face. The eyes
glared wildly, and the dark, malignant features were lit up with a
scornful scowl of more than human hate and triumph. It was the incarnation
of the Evil One exulting over a fallen and lost spirit. A loud shriek rent
the air behind me. I dared not turn my eyes from the horrid sight before
me. &ldquo;Oh, Heavens! it is true!&mdash;he is, he is the Tutore!&rdquo; I cried, as
the features, convulsed for an instant with fiendish triumph, resumed
their cold and even more appalling aspect. A threatening gesture from his
hand arrested me, as I was about to call aloud. My voice came not, though
my lips moved. I could not rise from the seat&mdash;a dreadful scream rang
through the building&mdash;another, and another followed&mdash;the figure
was gone. At the same moment the Count rushed forward&mdash;his dress
disordered, his hair falling loosely upon his shoulders&mdash;madness,
wild insanity, in his look. He turned and saw me; and bursting into a
torrent of hysterical laughter, cried out,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ha, ha, Carl!&mdash;welcome to our abode of pleasure; here, all is gaiety
and happiness. What sorrow ever crosses this threshold?&rdquo; and then, with a
sudden revulsion, he stared me fixedly, and said in a low sepulchral
voice, &ldquo;She is dead&mdash;dead! But the time is passing&mdash;a few
minutes more, and &lsquo;twill be too late. This, Carl, will explain all. Take
this, and this&mdash;these papers must be your care&mdash;promise me to
observe them to the letter; they were her&mdash;her last wishes, and you
knew her. Oh, is this a dream? it is too, too horrible to be real. Ah!&rdquo;
 said he, after a moment&rsquo;s pause; &ldquo;I am ready!&rdquo; and springing from me
wildly, rushed through the door towards the inner apartments.
</p>
<p>
I started up and followed him&mdash;I knew not which way he took in the
corridor; and as I stood uncertain, a loud report of fire-arms crashed on
my ear. I flew to the sick chamber&mdash;servants stood gasping and
trembling without, I tore open the door; there, lay the Count upon the
floor, his head rent asunder by the bullets from the pistol his hand still
grasped. He had endeavoured to reach the bed, and fell half upon a chair.
In the bed lay the still warm corpse of the Countess, beautiful as in
life. I looked from one to the other; my seared and stony heart, turned to
apathy by the horrors I had witnessed, gave no relief to its feeling in
tears, and I spoke not as I slowly left the room.
</p>
<p>
For two days I spoke not to any one. A dreamy unconsciousness seemed to
wrap my faculties, and I felt not the time passing. On the third day I
rallied sufficiently to open the papers the Count had entrusted to me. One
contained an affectionate farewell to myself, from the Count, with a dying
bequest; the other, was in a lady&rsquo;s hand&mdash;it bore the Countess&rsquo;s
signature; and here I discovered with surprise and horror, that to the
performance of the rash act, by which the Count had terminated his
existence, he was bound by a solemn oath. I ready and re-read, to assure
myself of the fact. It was true! Such was the terrible promise she
extorted from the wretched lover, under the delusive hope of their meeting
in another and happier life. Then followed the directions for the funeral,
which were minute to a degree. The bodies of both, when coffined, were to
be placed in a small temple in the garden, near the river; the key of
which was to be sent to a Dominican monk, who lived in an obscure part of
the city. By him were the coffins to be closed, which it was strictly
enjoined should be done by him, alone and unaccompanied, the night before
the burial.
</p>
<p>
All was done as the wish of the deceased enjoined, and the key despatched
by a trusty servant of my own to the friar, who appeared to be in
expectation of it, and knew its import.
</p>
<p>
I sat in the lonely and desolate room, which had formerly been mine, in
the villa of the Count; that long and dreary night the wind poured its
mournful wailing through the pine-trees in dirgeful memory of him who was
no more. From the window of the temple a bright light gleamed till near
morning, when it gradually faded away. Thither I repaired at day-break,
with the household. All was still&mdash;the door lay open&mdash;the
coffins were closed and screwed down. The friar was gone; we afterwards
found that he had not returned to his lodgings in the city, nor was he
ever after seen in Dresden. The bodies were committed to the earth, and I
returned to my home alone in the world.
</p>
<p>
It was several years after this&mdash;the awful death of my earliest, best
friend&mdash;that I arrived in Paris to exhibit, in the gallery of the
Luxembourg, an historical picture, upon which I had laboured for years. I
must be brief&mdash;my picture was exhibited, and my most sanguine
expectations surpassed by its success; and in a few short days the whole
scene of my early triumph was re-enacted. Praise and flattery poured in
upon me; and as in Dresden before, so now in Paris, I became the fashion
and the rage. But how changed was I! No longer exulting in my success, and
buoyant with hopes, I received all the adulation I met with, with cold
indifference and apathy.
</p>
<p>
Among the many attentions which my popularity had conferred upon me, was
an invitation to the Hôtel de Rohan. The Duke, a most distinguished
connoisseur in painting, having seen and applauded my picture, waited on
me. Thus bound in duty, I went; and fatigued by the round of soulless
gaiety, in what I could no longer feel happy, or even forgetful, I was
retiring early, when the Duke met me and said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, monsieur, I have been looking for you. The Comtesse de Julliart has
desired me to present you to her; and when I tell you that she is the most
beautiful woman in Paris, I need not say how much you must prize the
honour among all the distinctions your talents have earned. Come this
way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I followed mechanically&mdash;my heart took no interest in the scene&mdash;and
I only longed to be once more alone and unobserved. As I walked after the
Duke, he gave me a short account of the beautiful Countess, whom he
mentioned as the last descendant of an old and honoured family, supposed
to have been long since extinct, when she, a few months before, appeared
in Paris, and laid claim to the title. As she possessed unbounded wealth,
and had no great favours to ask any where, the Court were charmed with her
beauty, and readily admitted her claims, which some were ill-natured
enough to say were, perhaps, merely assumed without foundation.
</p>
<p>
I took little interest in the story. My thoughts were far away, as they
ever were for many years, from every thing of the present; and &lsquo;twas only
as I heard the Duke announce my name, among a group who stood near a sofa,
that I remembered why I was there.
</p>
<p>
The Countess sat with her back to us, but rose immediately on hearing my
name. I bowed deeply as she stood up; and recovering myself from my
obeisance, looked up. Oh, merciful Heaven, with what horror I looked!&mdash;It
was no other than La Mercia! With one loud cry of &ldquo;Tis she! &lsquo;tis she!&rdquo; I
fell fainting to the floor.
</p>
<p>
Weeks of wild raving and delirium followed. I left Paris!&mdash;I returned
to Dresden. There, all reminded me of the past. I fled from my home; and
now, after years of wandering in solitary and distant lands, I feel deep
in my heart the heavy curse that has followed upon my broken oath, and
which has made me an outcast and a broken-hearted wanderer in the world
for ever.

<h2>
THE PASS OF THE ARLBERG.
</h2>
<p>
Before leaving the Vorarlberg, and while now on its very frontier, I would
wish to keep some record of two very different but yet very characteristic
actions, of which this place was the scene. As you begin the ascent of the
Arlberg from the westward the road makes two very abrupt zigzags, being
carried along the edge of a deep precipice. On looking down over the low
battlements that guard the side of the way, you discover, immediately
under you, the spire and roofs of a small village several hundred feet
below. The churchyard, the little gardens, the narrow streets, and the
open &ldquo;Platz,&rdquo; where stands a fountain, are all mapped out distinctly. This
is the village of Steuben. A strange spot you would deem it for any to
have chosen as a dwelling-place, hemmed in between lofty mountains, on
whose bleak sides the snow is seen in the very midsummer; surrounded by
wild crags and yawning clefts, without even pasturage for any thing save a
goat: but your surprise will increase on learning that twice within the
last century has this village been swept away by falling avalanches. The
first time, the snow meeting in its descent from the mountains on either
side actually formed a bridge over a portion of the village; and the
houses thus saved were long regarded as under the special favour of the
Virgin, with whose image they were most bounteously decorated. The next
calamity, however, destroyed the prestige, for they were mingled in the
common destruction.
</p>
<p>
It would be difficult for &ldquo;Gentlemen of England, who live at home in
ease,&rdquo; to fancy any reason for this unaccountable selection of a residence
which adds the highest amount of peril to all the woes of poverty. But
every traveller has seen many such instances. In every mountain land they
are to be met with, and in each of the Alpine passes little groups of
houses&mdash;they can scarcely be called villages&mdash;can be detected in
spots where access is most difficult, where no feature around indicates
any means of supporting life, and where the precautions&mdash;simple and
ineffectual enough&mdash;against avalanches, shew that danger to be among
their calculations. How explain this? By what associations have these
dreary spots become hallowed into homes? Possibly the isolated lives of
these little families of men give them the same distaste to mixing with
their brethren of the great world, that is felt by a solitary recluse to
entering into society. Mayhap, too, the sense of peril itself has its
share in the attraction. There is no saying how far this feeling may go,
so strange and wayward are the caprices of human nature.
</p>
<p>
If you enter any of these villages, the narratives of snow storms, of
falling precipices, and &ldquo;Lavines,&rdquo; as avalanches are called, meet you at
every step. They are the great topics of these communities, as the
movements of Politics or the vacillations of the Bourse are elsewhere.
Scarcely one who has reached the middle term of life has not been, at
least once, in the most imminent peril; and these things are talked of as
the common accidents of existence, the natural risks of humanity! Very
strange does it sound to us who discuss so eagerly the perils of a wooden
pavement in our thoroughfares!
</p>
<p>
It is curious, too, to hear, as one may, most authentically, the length of
time life can be preserved beneath the snow. Individuals have been buried
so long as three entire days, and yet taken out alive. The cold, of which
it would be supposed they had suffered dreadfully, seems scarcely very
great; and the porous nature of the snow, and possibly the chinks and
crevices left between falling masses, have usually left air sufficient for
respiration. That individuals in such circumstances of peril are not,
always at least, devoid of their exercise of the faculties, I remember one
instance which is sufficiently convincing. It was in the Via Mala, about
five miles from the village of Splügen, where, in the year 1829, the
little cabriolet that conveyed the mail was swept away by an avalanche.
The calamity was not known for full seven or eight hours afterwards, when
some travellers from Andeer reaching the spot, found the road blocked up
by snow, and perceived a portion of the wooden rail of the road, and a
fragment of a horse-harness adhering to it, half-way down the precipice.
The guides of the party, well accustomed to reason from such sad premises,
at once saw what had happened. Conceiving, however, that the driver had
been carried down over the cliff, and consequently to certain death, they
directed their sole care to clearing a passage for the travellers. In so
doing, they proceeded with long poles to sound the snow, and ascertain to
what depth it lay unhardened. It was in one of these &ldquo;explorations,&rdquo; and
when the pole had sunk above ten feet deep into a mass of soft unfrozen
snow, that the man who held it found himself unable to withdraw the staff,
and called his comrades to aid him. They soon perceived, however, that the
resistance gradually yielded, and from the instinct peculiar to the &ldquo;hand&rdquo;&mdash;another
illustration for Sir Charles Bell&mdash;they recognised that it must be
the grip of human fingers which held the other end of the pole. They
immediately began to excavate on the spot, and in half an hour liberated
the poor postilion of the mail car, who, although hearing the shouts and
cries of the party for nearly an hour over his head, could not succeed in
making his own voice heard, and but for the fortunate accident of the pole
must have perished.
</p>
<p>
Many curious escapes were told to me, but this appeared most singular of
all; and now I come back to Steuben, or rather to the wild mountain above
it, over which, by a succession of windings, the road leads which joins
the Vorarlberg to the Tyrol. About one third of the ascent accomplished,
you come upon an abrupt turning of the way, in rounding which a wide
carriage can scarcely escape grating on the rock on one side, while from
the window on the opposite, the traveller looks down upon * gorge actually
yawning at his feet; the low barrier of wall, which does not rise above
the nave of the wheel, is a very frail and insignificant protection ok
such a spot, but when hid from view, as it is to those seated in a
carriage, the effect of the gulf is really enough to shake common nerves.
A little inscription upon a stone in this wall records the name of the
engineer&mdash;Donegani, if I remember aright&mdash;who, deeming this spot
the triumph of his skill, has selected it whereon to inscribe his
achievement. There is another meaning connected with the place, but
unrecorded; it could not, indeed, have been transmitted like that of the
Engineer, for when the event of which it treats occurred, there was
neither wall nor railing, and the road passed some twelve feet higher up,
over a ledge of rock, and actually seemed to jut out above the precipice.
There is, indeed, a memorial of the transaction to which I allude, but it
stands about twelve hundred feet down in the gorge below,&mdash;a small
wooden cross of rudest workmanship, with the equally rudely inscribed
words, &ldquo;Der Vorspann&rsquo;s Grab.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Now for the story, which happily is short.
</p>
<p>
It was late on a severe evening of winter, as a <i>calèche</i> drawn by
two horses drew up to the door of the post-house at Steuben; for then, as
now, Steuben was the last post-station before commencing the ascent of the
Arlberg. The travellers, two in number, wore military cloaks and foraging
caps; but what the precise rank, or to what arm of the service they
belonged, not even the prying observations of the host could fathom. Their
orders were for fresh horses immediately to cross the mountain, and
although the snow-drift was falling fast, and the night dark as pitch,
they peremptorily insisted on proceeding. The post regulations of those
days were not very stringent and arbitrary; as a post-master may seem
nowadays, he was nothing to the autocrat that once ruled the comings and
goings of unhappy travellers.
</p>
<p>
When he averred that his horses had done enough&mdash;that it was a
saint&rsquo;s-day&mdash;that the weather was too bad or his postilions too
weary, the case was hopeless, and the traveller was consigned, without
appeal, to the consolations of his own philosophy.
</p>
<p>
It chanced that on this occasion the whole disposable cavalry of the Post
consisted of two blind mares, which were both too old and weak to tempt
the cravings of the Commissary, who a few days before had seized on all
the draught-cattle to convey stores to Feldkirch, at that time menaced by
a French force under Massena.
</p>
<p>
The officers, however, were urgent in their demand; it was of the last
importance that they should reach Inspruck by the following evening. At
last, half by menace, half by entreaty, it was arranged that the two old
mares should be harnessed to the carriage, the host remonstrating all the
while on the inability of the expedient, and averring that, without a
Vorspann, a relay of horses, to lead at the steepest parts of the
mountain, the attempt would be fruitless. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;if you doubt
me, ask the boy who is sleeping yonder, and has been driving the Vorspann
for years over the Arlberg.&rdquo; The travellers turned and beheld on a heap of
straw, in the corner of the kitchen, a poor little boy, whose ragged
uniform of postilion had evidently reached him at third or fourth hand, so
large and loosely did it hang around his slender figure. He was sleeping
soundly, as well he might, for he had twice crossed the mountain to St.
Cristoph on that same day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this book,&rdquo; said one of the travellers, taking a very tattered and
well-thumbed volume which had dropped from the sleeper&rsquo;s fingers, &ldquo;has
this poor little fellow time to read?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He contrives to do it somehow,&rdquo; said the host, laughing; &ldquo;nay, more, as
you may see there, he has begun to teach himself French. Since he heard
that the French army was about to invade us, he has never ceased his
studies, sitting up half the night working at that old grammar there, for
which he gave all his month&rsquo;s earnings.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what maybe his reason for this?&rdquo; said the elder traveller, evidently
interested in the recital.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has got the notion, that if the French succeed in forcing the pass of
Feldkirch and enter the Tyrol, that, as he will be constantly engaged as
Vorspann on the mountain, his knowledge of French would enable him to
discover many secrets of the enemy, as no one would ever suspect a poor
creature like him of having learned a foreign language.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And his motive was then purely a patriotic one?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Purely; he is poor as you see, and an orphan, but his Tyrol blood runs
warm and thick in his veins.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what progress has he made?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That I cannot answer you, mein Herr; for no one hereabouts knows any
thing of French&mdash;nor, I suppose, had he ever the opportunity of
testing the acquirement himself. They are driven back, I am told.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For the present,&rdquo; said the elder stranger, gravely; &ldquo;but we shall need
all the reserves at Inspruck to hold our ground whenever they renew the
attack.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The sleeper was now aroused to take the saddle; for in the absence of the
regular postilion the Vorspann was obliged to take his place.
</p>
<p>
Still but half awake, the little fellow stood up, and mechanically
buttoning up his worn jacket, he took down his whip and prepared for the
road.
</p>
<p>
The travellers were soon ready, and ere many minutes elapsed the <i>calèche</i>
had left the village, and, with the best pace the old mares could
accomplish, was breasting the snow-drift and the first rise of the
mountain. After about an hour&rsquo;s driving, during which Joseph had exhibited
his utmost skill in taking advantage of every available bit of trotting
ground, they came at length to the commencement of the steep ascent; and
there, hanging his whip on the saddle-peak, the little fellow got down, to
relieve his cattle as they toiled up the precipitous ascent. He had not
gone far, when, happening to drop behind beside the <i>calèche</i>, what
did he hear but the sounds of that very language upon which all his day
and night dreams were set! All that he had remarked of the two travellers
was, that they wore cloaks of military cut and foraging caps, and now he
heard them conversing in French. The whole train of events on which his
mind so long had been dwelling came now forcibly before him. &ldquo;Feldkirch
had been forced, the French were already masters of the pass; in a few
days they would be over the Arlberg and in possession of all Tyrol!&rdquo; Such
was the terrible series of events a few words of French revealed to his
excited imagination. With this conviction he drew nearer and nearer the
door, till he could hear the very words they spoke. Now he returned to
accomplish the great purpose he had planned.
</p>
<p>
This &ldquo;Zuflucht-Haus&rdquo; or Hospice of Heinrich &ldquo;Findelkind&rdquo;&mdash;for he was
named the &ldquo;Foundling,&rdquo; having none to claim or acknowledge him&mdash;has
been superseded by a more commodious and better endowed edifice under the
auspices of the Imperial Government, who have gracefully preserved the
memory of the first founder; thus shewing themselves not ashamed to be
reminded of their own <i>devoirs</i> by a poor orphan.
</p>
<p>
And now from the heights of St. Christopher I look down upon the winding
glens and bold mountains of Tyrol! The great cross yonder on the rock
marks the boundary. And now, adieu! the square fur caps of the Bregenzer
Walderin; the huge silver filigree leaves, which look like peacocks&rsquo; tails
of frosted silver, fastened to the back of the head; the short-waisted
dresses, gaily embroidered with the wearer&rsquo;s initials upon the stomacher;
and the stockings, so piously adorned with saintly emblems; and last, but
not least, the peaceful quietude of a primitive people&mdash;to have lived
among whom is to carry away for life-long a pleasant memory of a
simple-minded, kindly peasantry.
</p>
<p>
On descending the Arlberg by the eastward, or the Tyrol side, there is a
little low ruin not far from the road. It stands nestled in a small nook
between the hills, and shews the stunted and cattle-cropped remains of a
few fruit-trees around. This was an ancient shrine where four monks
formerly lived, devoting their lives to aiding the travellers of the pass;
and some say that its foundation dates from that of the establishment of
St. Gallen in Switzerland, and that both owe their origin to the same
pious hand&mdash;an Irish monk. So is it incontestably true that the great
monastery of St. Gall, and the spacious convents of Mehrer-Au and Loch-Au
on the borders of the Lake of Constance, were founded by an Irishman. What
a destiny, that the nation whose mission should have been the spread of
Christianity in the earliest centuries, should present such a spectacle of
crime and God-forgetfulness in our own!

<h2>
CHAPTER XII.
</h2>
<p>
I wish my travelling countrymen&mdash;and what land tarns ont such myriads
of wanderers?&mdash;would betake themselves, in their summer rambles, to
the Tyrol, rather than Switzerland. If the use of German be not as
frequent with us as French, still very little suffices for the every-day
necessities of the road; and while, in point of picturesque beauty, the
tour is little, if any thing, inferior to Switzerland in all that regards
the people, the superiority of the Tyrolese is without a question.
</p>
<p>
Switzerland&mdash;save in some few remote spots of the German cantons, and
these not generally worth the visiting&mdash;is a land of extortion and
knavery. The whole country is laid out pretty much as St. Paul&rsquo;s in London
used to be, some years back&mdash;so much for the Aisle, so much for the
Whispering Gallery, so much for the Ball, &amp;c. Each mountain, each
glen, every glacier and snow-peak, has its corps of guides, farming out by
a tariff the wild regions of the roe and the chamois, and vulgarising the
features of nature to the level of the Colosseum in London, and its
pasteboard avalanches.
</p>
<p>
This may be all very delightful for those junket-ting parties who steam up
the Rhine on a three weeks&rsquo; excursion, and want to &ldquo;do Switzerland&rdquo; before
they reach home&mdash;jogging to Chamouni in an omnibus, and riding up the
Rigi in an ass-pannier. But to enjoy mountains&mdash;to taste really of
the exquisite sense of impressive solemnity a wild mountain-scene can
suggest,&mdash;give me the Tyrol&mdash;give me the land where the crashing
cataract is heard in the midst of unbroken stillness&mdash;where, in the
deep valleys, the tinkling bell of the herd sounds for miles afar&mdash;where,
better than all, the peasant is not degraded from his self-respect to
become a hanger-on of each stranger that he sees, but is still a peasant,
stout of heart and limb, ready to do the honours of his humble <i>châlet</i>
if you cross his threshold, but not bartering his native hospitality for
gold! What a fine national character is made up of that sturdy
independence&mdash;that almost American pride of equality&mdash;with the
devoted loyalty to their sovereign! How admirably does the sense of
personal freedom blend with obedience to the Kaiser! How intimately is
love of country bound up with fealty to the country&rsquo;s king! O Austria! if
all thy subjects were like these, how little need you fear revolutionary
Poles or reforming Popes! The sounds of the national sign, &ldquo;<i>Gott
erhalte unser Kaiser!</i>&rdquo; would drown the wildest cry that ever Anarchy
shouted.
</p>
<p>
The gifted advocates of Progress and Enlightenment, who write in Penny
Magazines and People&rsquo;s Journals, may sneer at the simple faith of a people
who recognise a father in their monarch&mdash;who are grateful for a
system of government that secures to them the peaceful enjoyment of their
homes and properties, with scarcely the slightest burden of taxation.
</p>
<p>
Such travellers as Inglis may record conversations with individuals
disposed to grumble at the few opportunities for social convulsion and
change; but, taking the mass of the people, judging from what is palpable
to every sojourner in the land, where does one see less of poverty&mdash;where
so much contentment, so much of enjoyment of life, such a general feeling
of brotherhood in every rank and class?&mdash;where are the graceful
virtues of charity and kindliness more conspicuous?&mdash;and, above all,
where is there so little of actual crime?
</p>
<p>
It may be said, the temptations are not so great to breaches of law where
a general well-being prevails, where each has enough for his daily wants,
and life displays no inordinate ambitions. I am willing to acknowledge all
this; I cavil not for the cause&mdash;I only ask acceptance for the fact.
If one would wish to see the boldest spirit of personal freedom united to
implicit obedience to a ruler, the most stubborn independence of character
with &amp; courteous submission to the will of him recognised as superior,
a manly self-reliance with a faithful trust that there are others better,
wiser, and more far-seeing than himself,&mdash;then let him come to the
Tyrol!
</p>
<p>
The Tyrol is, perhaps, the only part of Europe where any portion of
romance still dwells&mdash;where the little incidents of daily life are
tinctured with customs that derive from long ago&mdash;where facts of
bygone days, traditions of their fathers&rsquo; time, are interwoven with the
passing hour&mdash;and where primitive habits and tastes are believed to
carry with them a blessing, as to those who honour their fathers&rsquo;
memories. National gratitude is far more closely allied with individual
gratitude than is usually believed. Under the shade of the great tree the
little plant is often nurtured. It is easy to imagine well of the
individual, where the masses are moved by noble aspirations.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely a valley, not a single defile here, is without Us historic
glories&mdash;many of them as of yesterday, and yet, in their simple
heroism, recalling a time when personal valour was of greater worth than
strategic skill and science. I always regret that Scott, who understood
mountains and those who dwell thereon so thoroughly, should never have
made the Tyrol the scene of a romance.
</p>
<p>
Even among the &ldquo;simple annals of the poor&rdquo; here are little incidents
eminently romantic in their character, while so distinctly national that
they tell, in every detail, the mind of the people who enacted them.
</p>
<p>
How I should like once more to be young of heart and limb, and able to
travel these winding glens and climb these mountain steeps as once I could
have done! Even now, as I sit here in this little &ldquo;Wirth&rsquo;s-Haus,&rdquo; how the
old spirit of wandering comes back &lsquo;again as I watch the peasant, with his
long staff in hand, braving the mountain side, or standing for a second on
some rocky peak, to gaze down into the steep depth below&mdash;that narrow
valley filled by road and river.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Gott hat sein plan Für Jedenmann.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
What a road is that from Landeck to Meran!&mdash;at once the most
beautiful and the grandest of all the Tyrol passes. The gorge is so
narrow, that it seems rather like a deep channel cut by the river itself;
where, on either side, hundreds of feet in height, rise the rocks&mdash;not
straight, but actually impending above the head, leaving, in some places,
the ravine narrower above than beneath.
</p>
<p>
Escarped in this rock, the road winds on, protected by a little parapet
along the edge of the precipice. Beneath, at a depth to make the head
dizzy to gaze at, is seen the river, whose waters are of a pale sky-blue,
the most delicate and beautiful colour I ever beheld. As the necessities
of the road require, you have to cross the river; more than once, on
wooden bridges, which in themselves are curious for their ingenuity of
construction, if one could think of aught save the grandeur of the scene
around them.
</p>
<p>
At the second of these bridges, called the Pontlatzer
</p>
<p>
Brücke, the ravine grows wider, and open, a distant prospect of the
&ldquo;Kaunser-Thal,&rdquo; backed by the tremendous glacier of Gebatsch. A glorious
valley is it, with its grouped cottages and village spires studded along
the plain, through which the Inn winds its rapid stream, its surface still
ruffled and eddying from the deep descent of the Fünstermünze.
</p>
<p>
Above the Pontlatzer Brücke, high upon a little table-land of the
mountain, stands a small village&mdash;if even that humble name be not too
dignified for the little group of peasant-houses here assembled. This,
called the &ldquo;Kletscher,&rdquo; derives its title from a mountain torrent which,
leaping from cliff to cliff, actually divides the village into two
portions, over each of which, with pretty fair equality, it distributes
its spray and foam, and then plunges madly down, till, by a succession of
bounds and springs, it reaches the river Inn beneath. The Kletscher, it
must be owned, deserves its name: it is at once the most boisterous and
foam-covered torrent of the whole region, and, as frequently in its course
it pierces the soft rock of the mountain, the roaring stream echoes more
loudly still beneath these natural bridges. These, however, are not the
only sounds which greet the ear on nearing the spot: the whole air is
tremulous with the thumping and crashing noise of saw-mills, every second
cottage having one of these ingenious contrivances at work; and thus,
between the roaring torrent itself and its forced labour, such a
tremendous uproar is created, that the uninitiated are completely stunned.
</p>
<p>
It is, indeed, a curious transition from the deathlike stillness of the
pine forest, the unbroken silence of the steep path by which you wend your
way upward, to emerge at once into this land of active life and turmoil,
to see here, high amidst the Alps, where the roe and chamois are wild and
free&mdash;to see here a little colony busied in all the arts of life, and
carrying their industry into the regions of cataract and glacier.
</p>
<p>
What animation and movement on every side does that bright flowing torrent
carry with it! The axe of the wood-cutter&mdash;the rustling branches
sweeping, as twenty or thirty peasants tug some mighty pine-tree along&mdash;the
hacking clink of the bark adzes&mdash;the voices of the children gathering
and peeling the bark, and, above and through all, the heavy throbbing of
the mill-timbers, shaking the frail sheds and even the very cottages with
their giant strokes! There is a character of enterprise in the selection
of such a wild spot irresistibly captivating. One cannot look upon those
hardy peasants without a sense of respect and admiration for those who
have braved climate and danger&mdash;and such there is&mdash;to seek a
livelihood and a home, rather than toil in indigence and dependence in the
valley beneath.
</p>
<p>
The Kletscher is not picturesque for situation only. Its houses, built of
the pine-wood, are covered over with a kind of varnish, which, while it
preserves the colour, protects the timber from the effects of weather.
Each story is flanked externally by a little gallery, whose ornamental
balustrades display their native skill in carpentry, and are often
distinguished by grotesque carvings, executed with an ability that none
but a Tyroler could pretend to. The door and window-frames, too, are
finished in the same taste; while, instead of other designation, each
cottage is known by some animal of the owner&rsquo;s selection, which stands
proudly above the door-porch: and thus some old white-headed Bauer of
eighty winters is called the Chamois; a tart-looking, bitter-faced Frau,
his neighbour, being known as the Lamb; a merry little cheerful-eyed
peasant being a Buffalo; and the schoolmaster&mdash;I blush to write it&mdash;diffusing
&ldquo;Useful Knowledge&rdquo; under the sign of a braying Donkey.
</p>
<p>
Animated and cheerful as the scene is by day, alive with all the instincts
and sounds of happy labour, I like bettor to look upon it by night, when
all is calm and still, and nothing but the plash of the waterfall stirs
the air&mdash;to see these quaint old houses, with their sculptured
pinnacles and deep-shadowing eaves sleeping in the mellow moonlight&mdash;mill
and miller sunk in slumber&mdash;not a footstep nor a voice to be heard,
save one, the village watchman, going his nightly round, chanting his
little verse of assuring comfort to the waking ear, and making the
sleeper&rsquo;s dream a peaceful one.
</p>
<p>
See how he moves along, followed by his little dog, sleepy-looking and
drowsy as its master! He stands in front of that cottage&mdash;it belongs
to the Vorsteher, or ruler of the Dorf. Power has its privileges even
here, and the great man should know how the weather fares, and what the
hour is, if, perchance, the cares of state have kept him waking, as Homer
tells us that they can. Now he has ended his little song, and he wends his
way over the bridge of a single plank that spans the torrent; he slowly
descends the flight of stone steps, slippery with falling spray, and,
guided by the wooden railing, he treads the narrow path along the edge of
the cliff, which, nearly perpendicular, stands over the valley of the Inn.
There is a little hut here&mdash;a very poor and humble one, the very
poorest of the whole village&mdash;and yet it is before the door of this
lowly dwelling that the &ldquo;Nachtwachter&rdquo; stands at midnight each night
throughout the year, and then, as he calls the hour, he cries, &ldquo;Hans
Jörgle, good night!&mdash;rest soundly, Hans Jörgle!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Who can be this Hans Jörgle, for whose peaceful slumber authority is
watchful? If you care for the answer of the question, you must listen to a
story&mdash;if I dare to call by so imposing a name the following little
narrative&mdash;which, for want of better, I shall call
</p>

<h2>
HANS JÖRGLE
</h2>
<p>
Something short of forty years ago, there came to dwell at the Kletscher a
poor widow with one child, a boy of about nine years old. She never told
much of her history to the neighbours, and merely accounted for her choice
of this secluded spot from the circumstance that she had known it when a
child, her grandfather having been many years an inhabitant of the &ldquo;Dorf;&rdquo;
 and that, from dwelling on the pleasant days she had known there once, and
talking over them so often with her little Hans, she at last determined to
gratify him and herself by revisiting the cherished spot, hoping to end
her days there in peace.
</p>
<p>
The grandfather of whom she spoke&mdash;long since dead&mdash;had been
well known and respected in the village; so that, at first on his account,
and subsequently on her own, the widow was welcomed kindly amongst them.
Her subsistence was derived principally from a small pension she received
from the Government, for her husband had been a grenadier of the Austrian
Imperial Guard, and fell on the field of Austerlitz. This little pittance
would not have sufficed for wants even humble as hers, without the aid of
her own industry; but she was clever at her needle, and could accomplish
many a triumph in millinery above village skill; and by the exertion of
this art she contrived to eke out a subsistence&mdash;in poverty, it is
true, but in contentment also.
</p>
<p>
If little Hans Jörgle could not contribute to the common stock by any
efforts of his labour, his gentle, quiet nature, his guileless innocence,
won for him the love of all the village. Old and young were pleased to see
him, and to talk to him; for, child as he was, Hans had read a great many
books, and could tell the most wonderful stories about the Swedes in the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and also what happened in the long wars between
Frederic of Prussia and the Austrians&mdash;stories that, if Hans were
fond of telling, his audience were far more delighted to listen to. This
amusing gift, joined to the claims of infirmity&mdash;for he was lame, the
effect of a fall in his infancy&mdash;made him a favourite with every one;
for even they&mdash;and the number was a small one&mdash;who could not
relish his stores of narrative could feel compassion for the little
fatherless boy, bereft of the means of earning a livelihood, and wholly
dependent on one whose frail health gave little promise of long life.
</p>
<p>
Hans was tall and slight, and, but for his lameness, would haye been as
remarkable for the symmetry of his form, as, even with it, he was for
agility. His countenance was eminently handsome; the brow lofty, and the
eyes, which were of the darkest blue, were set deeply; their habitual
expression was one of great melancholy&mdash;not the sorrow of infirm
health, or the depression of a heart in conflict with itself, but the
sadness of a spirit too finely attuned for its daily associations&mdash;above,
immeasurably above, all around in its ambitions, and yet an object of
actual pity and compassion! The prevailing tone of his mind, though
sorrowful, did not prevent his joining the village children at their play;
nor was he, perhaps, the less welcome amongst them for those strange fits
of absence which, seizing him in the midst of some rural sport, would make
him forget all around, and burst out with some exciting anecdote of heroic
daring, some bold achievement of the Austrians in their memorable battles
with the Turks. Then, would the day cease; gradually gathering around him,
the children would form a circle, soon to be strengthened by their elders,
who took the most lively pleasure in these recitals,&mdash;tales which
many a setting sun and rising moon shone upon.
</p>
<p>
It may have been remarked by the reader, that Hans&rsquo; literary stores were
all military. Such was the case. Battles and sieges, campaigns and
marches, were a passion so exclusive, that he had no interest left for any
other form of reading. This may seem strange in one so young, and in one,
too, whose nature was gentleness itself; his very infirmity, besides,
might have turned his thoughts away from themes in which he never could be
a participator: but how little have material influences power over the
flight of a highly imaginative nature! His father&rsquo;s stories as he sat at
the fireside, his earliest lessons in reading, implanted the impulse,
which the very events of the time served to strengthen and mature.
</p>
<p>
It was just the period when the Tyrol, crushed by the oppression of
Bavaria, insulted and outraged in every feeling, had begun to think of
vengeance. The transient success of the Austrians on the Danube animated
the brave mountaineers, and cheered them with the hope of freedom. Already
the low muttering of the distant storm was heard. Wherever a group of
peasants gathered, their low whisperings, their resolute looks, their
clenched hands, denoted some stern purpose. Secret Masses were said in the
chapels for the &ldquo;rescue of the Vaterland;&rdquo; the ancient legends of the land
were all remembered; sights and sounds of ominous meaning were reported to
have been observed; all indicative of a speedy convulsion, all suggesting
hope and courage. Rumour had told of conferences between the Archduke John
of Austria and the Tyrol leaders; not failing to exaggerate the aid
proffered by the Imperial Government in the event of a struggle. The
ancient spirit of the land was up, and only waited the signal for the
fight.
</p>
<p>
Remote and secluded as the little village of my story lay, the news of the
coming conflict did not fail to reach it. Little Hans formed the link
which bound them to the world of the valley beneath; and daily did he, in
despite of lameness, descend the steep path that led to the Pontlatzer
Brucke, bringing back with him towards nightfall the last rumours of the
day. Vague and uncertain as they were, they were listened to with
breathless eagerness. Sometimes, the intelligence merely announced a
gathering of the peasants in a mountain glen; sometimes, the arrival of a
messenger with secret despatches from Vienna. Now, Hofer had passed
through Maltz the night before; now, it was a Bavarian reinforcement was
seen arriving at Landeck.
</p>
<p>
These simple tidings had seemed of little meaning to their ears if Hans
were not there to give them significance, filling up all the blanks by
wise surmises, and suggesting reasons and causes for every thing. He had
his own theory of the war&mdash;where the enemy should be met, and how; in
what manner certain defiles should be defended, and how, in case of
defeat, the scattered forces might re-unite; little views of strategy and
tactics, that seemed like inspiration to the simple ears who beard him.
</p>
<p>
Hans&rsquo; tidings grew daily more important; and one evening he returned to
the Kletscher with a sealed note for the Curate&mdash;a circumstance which
excited the most intense curiosity in the Dorf. It was not long
ungratified, for the old priest speedily appeared in the little square
before the Vorsteher&rsquo;s House, and announced that each evening, at sunset,
a Mass would be said in the chapel, and a prayer invoked on all who loved
&ldquo;Gott, der Kaiser, und das Vaterland.&rdquo; Hans was pressed on every side;
some asking what was going on in the valley, others eager to hear if the
Austrians had not been defeated, and that the Mass was for the slain. Hans
knew less than usual; he could only tell that large bodies of the
peasantry were seen ascending the mountain towards Landeck, armed with
saws and hatchets, while kegs of blasting powder were borne along between
others. &ldquo;We shall know more, soon,&rdquo; added Hans; &ldquo;but come! the chapel is
lighted already; the Mass has begun.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
How picturesque was the effect the chapel presented! The sun was setting,
and its long golden rays, mingled with the red light of the tapers,
tipping the rich draperies of the altar and its glittering vessels with a
parti-coloured light; the kneeling figures of the peasantry, clad in all
the varied colours of Tyrol taste; the men bronzed by sun and season,
dark-bearded, stern, and handsome; the women fairer, but not less earnest
in expression; the white-haired priest, dressed in a simple robe of white,
with a blue scarf over it&mdash;the Bavarians had stripped the chapels
even of the vestments of the clergy&mdash;the banners of the little
volunteer battalion of the mountain waving overhead,&mdash;all, made up a
picture simple and unpretending, but still solemn and impressive.
</p>
<p>
The Mass ended, the priest addressed a few words on the eventful position
of the Vaterland&mdash;at first, in terms of vague, uncertain meaning; but
growing warmer as he proceeded, more clearly and more earnestly, he told
them that the &ldquo;Wolves&rdquo;&mdash;none needed to be told that Frenchmen were
meant&mdash;that the &ldquo;Wolves&rdquo; were about to ravage the flocks and overrun
the villages, as they had already done twice before; that the Bavarians,
who should be their friends, were about to join their bitterest enemies;
that although the &ldquo;Gute Franzerl&rdquo;&mdash;for so familiarly did they ever
name the Emperor&mdash;wished them well, he could help them but little.
&ldquo;The Tyroler&rsquo;s hand alone must save Tyrol,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If that cannot
be, then God pity us; for there is no mercy to be looked for from our
enemies!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If many a bold and patriotic heart sorrowed over these things, not one
felt them with a more intense sense of anguish than little Hans Jörgle.
The French, who had crushed his country, had killed his father; and now
they were coming to bring fire and sword among those lonely glens, where
his widowed mother had hoped to live her last years peacefully. Oh! if he
had been a man to stand beside his father in the day of battle, or if even
now he could hope to see the time when he should be strong of limb as he
was of heart... a burst of tears was the ever-present interruption to
utterings which, in the eagerness of his devotion, he could not resist
from making aloud.
</p>
<p>
These thoughts now took entire possession of his mind. If the clatter of
horses&rsquo; hoofs was heard unusually loud over the wooden bridge in the
valley, Hans would start up and cry, &ldquo;Here they are!&mdash;the cavalry
picquets are upon us!&rdquo; If a Bauer-house in the plain caught fire, it was
the French were approaching and burning the villages. The rumbling of
heavily-laden sledges over the hard snow was surely &ldquo;the drums of the
advanced guard;&rdquo; and never could the ring of jäger&rsquo;s rifle be heard, that
he did not exclaim, &ldquo;Here come the skirmishers!&rdquo; If the worthy villagers
were indifferent to these various false alarms, the epithets and terms of
war employed by Hans realised no small portions of its terror; and while
they could afford to smile at his foolish fears, they exchanged very grave
looks when he spoke of cavalry squadrons, and looked far from happy at the
picture of a brigade of artillery in position on the bridge, while the
tirailleurs ascended the face of the mountain in scattered parties.
</p>
<p>
While the winter continued, and the snow lay deep upon the roads, and many
of the bridges were removed for safety from the drifting ice, the
difficulties to a marching force were almost insurmountable; but as the
spring came, and the highways cleared, the rumour again grew rife that the
enemy was preparing his blow: the great doubt was, by which of the Alpine
passes he would advance.
</p>
<p>
Staff-officers and engineers had been despatched from Vienna to visit the
various defiles, and suggest the most efficient modes of defence.
Unhappily, however, all their counsels were given with a total ignorance
of the means of those by whom they were to be executed. To speak of
fortifying Landeck, and entrenching here and stockading there, sounded
like an unknown tongue to these poor chamois-hunters, whose sole idea of
defence lay in the cover of a crag and the certainty of a rifle bullet.
</p>
<p>
Disappointed, then, in their hope of aid, they betook themselves to their
own devices, and hit upon a plan the most perfectly adapted to the crisis,
as well as the most suitable to their own means of accomplishment. Is it
necessary that I should speak of what is so familiar to every reader? the
rude preparations of the Tyrolers to defend their native defiles, by
trunks of trees and fragments of rocks, so disposed that at a word they
could be hurled from the mountains down into the valleys beneath.
</p>
<p>
The pass I here speak of was eminently suited for this, not only from its
narrowness and the precipitate nature of its sides, but that the timber
was large and massive, and the rocks, in many cases, so detached by the
action of the torrents, that little force was required to move them. Once
free, they swept down the steep sides, crushing all before them; loosening
others as they went, and with a thunder louder than any artillery,
plunging into the depths below. Simple as these means of defence may seem&mdash;it
is but necessary to have once seen the country to acknowledge how
irresistible they must have been&mdash;there was positively no chance of
escape left. The road, exposed in its entire length, lay open to view;
beneath it, roared a foaming torrent, above, stood cliffs and crags the
hardiest hunter could not clamber; and if, perchance, some little path led
upwards to a mountain <i>chalet</i> or a Dorf, a handful of Tyrol riflemen
could have defended it against an army.
</p>
<p>
All was arranged early in the year, and it was determined that the revolt
should break forth a week or ten days before the time when the Bavarians
were to march the reliefs to the various garrisons&mdash;a movement which,
it was known, would take place in the spring. By signal-fires in the
mountain-tops, intimation was to be given to those who inhabited the
Alpine regions; while for those in the plains, and particularly in the
valley of the Inn&mdash;the great line of operations&mdash;the signal was
to be given by sawdust thrown on the surface of the stream. A month, or
even more, was to elapse from the time I have just spoken of ere the
preparations would be fully made. What an interval of intense anxiety was
that to poor Hans!
</p>
<p>
A small detachment of Bavarian infantry, now stationed at the Pontlatzer
Brücke, made it unsafe to venture often, as before, into the valley. Such
frequent coming and going would have excited suspicion; and the interval
between suspicion and a drum-head tribunal was a short one, and generally
had a bloody ending. Hans could do little more, then, than sit the
livelong day on the brow of the cliff, watching the valley, straining his
eyes along the narrow glen towards Landeck, or gazing over the wide
expanse to the Kaunser-Thal. How often did his imagination people the
space beneath with an armed host! and how did he build up before his
mind&rsquo;s eye the glitter of steel, the tramp and dust of mounted squadrons,
the long train of ammunition waggons, the gorgeous staff&mdash;all the
&ldquo;circumstance of glorious war!&rdquo; And how strangely did it seem, as he
rubbed his eyes and looked again, to see that silent valley and that
untrodden road, the monotonous tramp of the Bavarian sentry the only sound
to be heard! On the chapel door the previous Sunday some one had written
in chalk, &ldquo;<i>Ist zeit?</i>&mdash;Is it time?&rdquo; to which another had
written for answer, &ldquo;<i>Bald zeit</i>&mdash;It will soon be!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
 thought Hans, &ldquo;that it were come at last!&rdquo; And a feverish eagerness had so
gained possession of him, that he scarcely could eat or sleep, starting
from his bed at night to peep out of the window and see if the signal fire
was not blazing.
</p>
<p>
The devotional feeling is, as I have remarked, the most active and
powerful in a Tyroler&rsquo;s heart; and deeply intent as each was now on the
eventful time that drew nigh, the festival of Easter, which intervened, at
once expelled all thoughts save those pertaining to the solemn season. Not
a word, not a syllable, fell from any lip evincing an interest in their
more worldly anxieties. The village chapel was crowded from before
daybreak to late in the evening; the hum of prayer sounded from every
cottage; and scarcely was there time for the salutations of friends, as
they met, in the eagerness to continue the works of some pious ritual.
</p>
<p>
I know not if Hans Jörgle was as deeply impressed as his neighbours by
these devout feelings; I only can tell that he refrained as rigidly as the
others from any allusion to the coming struggle, and never by a chance
word shewed that his thoughts were wandering from the holy theme. A very
prying observer, had there been such in the Dorf, might perhaps have
detected that the boy&rsquo;s eyes, when raised in prayer, rested longer on the
spot where the striped banners of Tyroler chivalry waved overhead, or that
an expression of wild excitement rested on his features as the different
groups, before entering the church, deposited their broadswords and rifles
in the porch,&mdash;every clank of the weapons seemed to thrill through
Hans&rsquo; heart.
</p>
<p>
The devotional observances over, Easter Monday came with all the joyous
celebrations with which the villagers were wont to <i>fête</i> that happy
day. It was a time for families to assemble their scattered members, for
old and attached friends to renew the pledges of their friendship, for
those at variance with each other to become reconciled; little children
paid visits to their grandfathers and grandmothers, with bouquets of
spring flowers, repeating the simple verses of some village hymn to
welcome in the morning; garlands and wreaths hung from every door-porch;
lovers scaled up the galleries to leave a rose, or an Alp daisy, plucked
some thousand feet high among the snow-peaks, at their sweethearts&rsquo;
window. Pious souls made little presents to the Curé in the chapel itself.
The cattle were led through the village in a great procession, with
garlands on their heads and fresh flowers fastened to their horns; the
villagers accompanying them with a Tyrol song, descriptive of the
approaching delights of summer, when they could quit their dark dwellings
and rove free and wild over their native hills. It was joy every where: in
the glad faces and the glancing eyes, the heartfelt embraces of those who
met and saluted with the well-known &ldquo;<i>Gott grilse dich</i>&mdash;God
greet thee!&rdquo; in the little dwellings pranked with holly-boughs and wild
flowers; in the chapel glittering with tapers on every altar, pious
offerings of simple hearts; in the tremulous accents of age, in the
boisterous glee of childhood, it was joy.
</p>
<p>
It was the season of gifts, too. And what scenes of pleasure and delight
were there, as some new arrival from the valley displayed before the
admiring eyes of a household some little toy, the last discovery of
inventive genius: Bauer-houses, that took to pieces and exhibited all
their interior economy at will; saw-mills, that actually seemed to work,
so vigorously did they perform the incessant time that mark their labour;
dolls of every variety of attraction, but all in Tyrol taste; nutcrackers
that looked like old men, but smashed nuts with the activity of the
youngest; soldiers of lead, stout-looking fellows, that never quitted the
posts committed to them, if the wire was not too powerful&mdash;all were
there; appearing, besides, with a magic in true keeping with their
wonderful properties. Some emerged from unknown pockets in the cuff of a
jacket; others, from the deep waistband of particoloured leather; some,
from the recesses of a hat: but all in some wonderful guise that well
became them.
</p>
<p>
In one cottage only this little festive scene was not enacted. Hanserl&rsquo;s
mother, who for some time back had been in declining health, was unable to
contribute, as she was wont, to their support. Too proud to confess her
poverty in the village, she contrived to keep up all the externals of
their condition as before. She and her son were seen on Sunday as well
dressed as ever; perhaps, if any thing, a more than ordinary attention in
this respect could be detected. Her offering to the curate rather exceeded
than fell short of its customary amount, These were, however, costly
little sacrifices to pride; for these, their meal was made scantier and
poorer; for these, the hours of the wintry night were made longer and
drearier, as, to save the cost of candle-light, they sat in darkness
beside the stove; a hundred little privations, such as only poverty knows
or can sympathise with, fell to their lot; all, borne with fortitude and
patience, but in their slow process chilling and freezing up the hope from
which these virtues spring.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hanserl, my love,&rdquo; said the poor widow, and her eyes swam and her tongue
faltered as she spoke, &ldquo;thou hast had none of the pleasures of this joyous
day. Take these twelve kreutzers and buy thyself something in the Dorf.
There be many pretty things cost not more than twelve kreutzers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Hanserl made no answer; his thoughts were wandering far away. Heaven knows
whether they had strayed back to the bold days of Wallenstein, or the
siege of Prague, or were now, with the stormy cataract of the Danube&mdash;at
the iron gate, as it is called, the desperate scene of many a bloody
meeting between Turks and Austrians.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hans, love, dost hear me? I say, thou canst buy a bow with arrows; thou
hast long been wishing for one. But bring no more books of battles,
child,&rdquo; added she, more feelingly; &ldquo;strife and war have cost us both
dearly. If thy father had not served the Kaiser, he would not have fallen
at Elchingen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it well,&rdquo; said the boy, his features flashing as he spoke. &ldquo;He
would not have stood beside the ammunition-waggons when the French
dragoons bore down, and with a loud voice called out, &lsquo;Halt! these
tumbrels are powder; another step and I&rsquo;ll explode the train!&rsquo; How they
reined up and fled! My father saved the train; didn&rsquo;t he, mother?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; sobbed the widow; &ldquo;and fell under the wall of the citadel as the
last waggon entered the gate.&lsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;God preserve Franz the Emperor!&rdquo; said the boy, with a wild enthusiasm;
&ldquo;he has given many a brave soldier a glorious grave. But for this,&rdquo; here
he struck his shrunken limb violently with his hand, &ldquo;I, too, had been
able to serve him. But for this&mdash;&rdquo; a passion of sorrow, that found
vent in tears, checked his words, and he buried his head in his hands and
sobbed hysterically.
</p>
<p>
The poor mother did everything she could think of to console her son. She
appealed to his piety for submission under a visitation of God&rsquo;s own
making; she appealed to his affection for her, since, had it not been for
his helplessness, he might one day have left her to be a soldier.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The conscription is so severe now, Hanserl that they take only sons away,
like the rest&mdash;ay, and when they are but thirteen years of age! Take
them away, and leave the mothers childless! But they cannot take thee,
Hans!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that they cannot,&rdquo; cried the boy, in a burst of grief. &ldquo;The cripple
and the maimed have not alone to weep over their infirmity, but to feel
themselves dishonoured before others.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The widow saw the unhappy turn her consolations had taken, and tried in
different ways to recall her error. At last, yielding to her entreaties,
Hans left the cottage, taking the twelve kreutzers in his hand to buy his
Easter gift.
</p>
<p>
It was from no want of affection to his mother he acted, nor was it from
any deficiency of gratitude that when he left the hut he forgot all about
the toy, and the twelve kreutzers, and the <i>fête</i> itself. It was that
a deeper sentiment had swallowed up every other, and left no place in his
heart for aught else.
</p>
<p>
Hans then sauntered along, and at last found himself on the little
projecting point of rock from which he usually surveyed the valley of the
Kaunser-Thal. There, he sat down and watched till the darkness thickened
around and hid out every thing.
</p>
<p>
When he arose to turn homeward the lights were glittering in every window
of the village, and the merry sounds of rustic music filled the air. Hans
suddenly remembered it was Easter-night, the glad season of home
rejoicings, and he thought of his poor mother, who sat alone, unfriended
and suffering, in her little cabin. A feeling of self-reproach at once
struck him, and he turned speedily toward the cottage. His shortest way
was through the village, and thither he bent his steps. The night was
starlit but dark, and none of the villagers were in the street; indeed,
all were too happy within doors to wander forth. In the Vorsteher&rsquo;s house
the village band was assembled, and there the merry notes of a hopsa waltz
were accompanied by the tramp of feet and the sound of mirthful voices. A
little farther on was a rich peasant&rsquo;s house. Hans stopped to peep through
the half-closed shutters, and there sat the family at their supper. It was
a well-filled board, and many a wine-flask stood around, while the savoury
steam rose up and hung like a feint cloud above the dishes&mdash;not
sufficiently, however, to obscure a little larch-tree, which, set in a
small bucket, occupied the centre of the table. On this all the candles
were fastened, glittering like stars through the sprayey branches, and
glancing in bright sparkles over a myriad of pretty toys that hung
suspended around. For this was the Easter-tree, to which every friend of
the house attaches some little present. Many a more gorgeous epergne has
not yielded one hundredth part of the delight. Every eye was fixed upon
it; some in pure astonishment and wonder, others speculating what might
fall to their share; and while the old grandfather tried to curb
impatience among the elder children, the young baby, with the destructive
privilege that belongs to infancy, was permitted to pull and tear from
time to time at the glittering fruit,&mdash;little feats which excited as
much laughter from the grown people as anxiety from the younger.
</p>
<p>
Hans moved on, with a sigh, at these new signs of home happiness in which
he had no share. The next was the Curate&rsquo;s cabin, and there sat a pleasant
party round the stove, while the old priest read something from an amusing
volume; the lecture never proceeding far without some interruption to
comment upon it, to indulge a laugh, or mayhap clink their glasses
together, as, in token of friendship, they pledged each other health and
long life. Beyond this again was a new cabin, just taken possession of;
and here Hans, peeping in, beheld a young Tyroler exhibiting to his wife&mdash;(they
had been married but a few weeks)&mdash;his new rifle. It was strange to
see how she admired the weapon, gazing at it with all the delight most of
her sex reserve for some article of dress or decoration. She balanced it,
too, in her hand, and held it to her shoulder, with the ease of one
accustomed to its use.
</p>
<p>
In every cabin some group, some home picture, met his eye; peaceful age,
happy manhood, delighted childhood, beamed around each hearth and board.
The song, the dance, the merry story, the joyous meal, succeeded each
other, as he went along. He alone, of all, was poor and sad: in his
mother&rsquo;s hut all was darkness and gloom; the half-suppressed sigh of pain
the only sound. The last cabin of the village, and the poorest too,
belonged to an old peasant, who had been a soldier under the Emperor
Joseph; he was a very old man, and being burdened with a large family of
grandchildren, whose parents were both dead, all he could do by hard
labour was to maintain his household, &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; thought Hans, as he stopped
to look in, &ldquo;here are some poor as ourselves,&mdash;I hope they are
happier.&rdquo; So they seemed to be. They were all seated on the floor of the
cabin, with the grandfather among them on a low stool, while he performed
for them the evolutions of the Grand Army at Presburg&mdash;the great
review which Maria Theresa held of all the Imperial troops. The old man
was sorely puzzled to convey a sufficiently formidable notion of the
force, for he had only some twenty little wooden soldiers to fill up the
different arms of the service, and was obliged to plant individuals to
represent entire corps, while walnut-shells answered for field-pieces and
mortars; the citadel of Presburg being performed by the bowl of hit
Meerschaum pipe.
</p>
<p>
There were many more brilliant displays met Hans&rsquo; eyes that evening than
this humble spectacle, and yet not one had the same attraction for him.
What would he not have given to be among that group&mdash;to have watched
all the evolutions, many of which were now hidden from his view&mdash;perchance
to be permitted to move some of the regiments, and suggest his own ideas
of tactics! Ah, that would have been happiness indeed! How long he might
have watched there is no saying, when a slight incident occurred which
interrupted him&mdash;slight and trivial enough was it, and yet in all its
seeming insignificance to be the turning point of his destiny!
</p>
<p>
It chanced that one of the little soldiers, from some accident or other,
would not stand upright, and a little boy, whose black eyes and sunburnt
cheeks bespoke a hasty temper, in endeavouring to set him on his legs,
broke one of them off. &ldquo;Ah, thou worthless thing!&rdquo; cried he passionately,
&ldquo;thou art no use now to King or Kaiser, for thou art as lame as Hans
Jörgle;&rdquo; and as he spoke he opened the little pane of the window, and
flung the little figure into the street.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shame on thee, Carl!&rdquo; said the old man reprovingly; &ldquo;he would have done
for many a thing yet. The best scout we ever had on the Turkish frontier
was so lame, you couldn&rsquo;t think him able to walk. Besides, don&rsquo;t you
remember the Tyrol proverb?&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
‘Gott hat sein plan Fur Jedenmann:&rsquo;

God has his plan For every man.
</pre>
<p>
So never despise those who are unfit for thine own duties; mayhap, what
thou deemest imperfection, may fit them for something far above thee.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Oh, how Hans drank in these words! the grief that filled him, on the
insulting comparison of the child was now changed to gratitude, and
seizing the little soldier, his own sad emblem, he kissed it a hundred
times, and then placed it in his bosom.
</p>
<p>
Hanserl&rsquo;s mother was asleep when he reached home, so, creeping silently to
his bed, he lay down in his clothes, dreading lest he might awaken her;
and with what a happy heart did he lie down that night! How full of
gratitude and of love as he thought over the blessed words! How he wished
to remain awake all night long and think over them, fancying, as he could
do, the various destinies which, even to such as him, might still fall!
But sleep, that will not come when wooed, stole over him as he lay, and in
a deep, heavy slumber, he clasped the little wooden figure in his hands.
</p>
<p>
The first effect of weariness over, Hans dreamed of all he had seen; vague
and confused images of the different objects passed and re-passed before
his mind, in that disorder and incoherency that belong to dreams. The
scene of the Vorsteher&rsquo;s house became mingled with the remembrance of the
Pontlatzer bridge, where, until nightfall, he had been watching the
Bavarian sentinel; and the curate&rsquo;s parlour beside its listening group,
had, now, a merry mob of children dancing around the Easter-tree, under
whose spreading branches a cavalry picquet were lying&mdash;the horses
grazing&mdash;while the men lay stretched before the watch-fires, smoking
and chattering.
</p>
<p>
The memory of the soldiers once touched upon, every other fled; and now he
could only think of the evolutions around Presburg: and he fancied he saw
the whole army defiling oyer the bridge across the Danube, and
disappearing within the ancient gates of the city. The white-cloaked
cuirassiers of Austria, gigantic forms, seeming even greater from the
massive folds of their white drapery; the dark Bohemians on their
coal-black horses; the Uhlans with their banners floating from their tall
lances; the prancing Hungarians mounted on their springing white steeds of
Arab blood; the gay scarlet of their chakos, the clink of their dolmans,
all glitter-* ing with gold, eclipsing all around them. Then came the
Jagers of the Tyrol, a countless host, marching like one man, their dark
plumes waving like a vast forest for miles in distance. These followed
again by the long train of guns and ammunition carts.
</p>
<p>
Fitful glances of distant lands, of which he had once read, passed before
him: the wide-spreading plains of the Lower Danube&mdash;the narrow passes
of the Styrian Alps&mdash;the bleak, vast tracts of sterile country on the
Turkish frontier, with here and there a low mud-walled village, surmounted
by a minaretted tower;&mdash;all, however, were peopled with soldiers,
marching or bivouacking, striking their tents at day-break, or sitting
around their camp-fires by night. The hoarse challenge of the sentries,
the mellow call of the bugle, the quivering tramp of a mounted patrol,
were all vividly presented to his sleeping senses. From these thoughts of
far-away scenes, he was suddenly recalled to home, and his own Tyrol land.
He thought he stood upon the rocky cliff and looked down into the valley
which he had left so tranquil at nightfall, but which now presented an
aspect of commotion and trouble. The inhabitants of the little village at
the head of the Kaunser-Thal were all preparing to quit their homes and
fly up the valley; carts covered with their furniture and effects crowded
the little street; pack-horses and mules laden with every thing portable;
while in the eager and affrighted gestures of the peasants it was easy to
see that some calamity impended. Now and then some horseman would ride in
amongst them, and by his manner it was plain the tidings he brought were
full of disaster. Hans looked towards the bridge: and there, to his
astonishment, he saw the very same soldiers the old man had manoeuvred
with. They had, seemingly, come off a long march, and with their knapsacks
unstrung, and their arms piled, were regaling themselves with wine from
the guard-house.
</p>
<p>
Hans&rsquo; first thought was to hasten back and tell his mother what he saw;
and now he stood up and leaned over her bed, but her sleep was so tranquil
and so happy he could not bear to awaken her. &ldquo;What can it mean?&rdquo; thought
he. &ldquo;Are these the movements of our own people? or are the French wolves
coming down upon us?&rdquo; As he ruminated thus, he thought there came a gentle
tap at the door of the hut: he opened it cautiously, and there, who should
be standing before him but the lame soldier, his own poor little fellow,
the castaway?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come along, Hans,&rdquo; said he in a friendly voice; &ldquo;there is little time to
lose. The Wolves are near.&rdquo; He pressed his finger to his lips, in token of
caution, and led Hans without the door. No sooner were they outside than
he resumed,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thou art maimed and crippled like myself, Hans Jörgle. We should be but
indifferent front-rank men before the enemy: but remember the Tyrol
proverb,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
‘Gott hat sein plan Für Jedenmann.&rsquo;
</pre>
<p>
Who knows if even we cannot serve the Vaterland? We must away, Hanserl&mdash;away
to the top of the Kaiser-fells, where the fagots lie ready for the signal
fire. The Bavarians have found out where it lies, and have sent a scout
party to destroy it, while their battalions are advancing by forced
marches up the Inn Thai. Thou knowest all these paths well, Hans; so lead
the way, my brave boy, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to follow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Hans waited for no further bidding, but hastily crossing the little wooden
bridge, commenced the ascent of the mountain with an activity that bore no
trace of his infirmity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We must light the beacon, Hans,&rdquo; said the lame soldier. &ldquo;When it is seen
blazing, the signal will be repeated up the Kaunser-Thal; Fünstermünze
will have it; and then Nauders. Maltz will shew it next, and then all
Tyrol will be up. The war jodeln will resound in every valley and glen,
and then let the Wolves beware!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Oh, how Hans strained each nerve and sinew to push forward! The path led
across several torrents, many of them by places which, in day, demanded
the greatest circumspection, but Hans cleared them now at a spring. The
deep marshy ground, plashy with rivulets and melted snow, he waded through
ankle deep, climbing the briery rocks and steep banks without a moment&rsquo;s
halt.
</p>
<p>
He thought that the lame soldier continued to exhort him, and encourage
his zeal, while gradually his own pace slackened, and at last he cried
out,&mdash;&ldquo;I can do no more, Hans. Thou must go forward alone, my boy,&mdash;to
thee all the glory,&mdash;I am old and worn out! Hasten, then, my child,
and save the Vaterland. Thou wilt see the tinder-box and the rags in the
hollow pine-tree beside the faggot. It is wrapped in tow, and will light
at once. Farewell, and Gott guide thee!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I cannot tell a thousandth part of the dangers and difficulties of that
night&rsquo;s walk: in one place the path, for several yards, is on the brink of
a ravine, eleven hundred feet deep, and so abrupt is the turn at the end,
that an iron hook is inserted in the rock, by which the traveller must
grip; a steep glacier is to be crossed farther on; and lastly, the torrent
of the Kletscher must be traversed on a tree, whose bark, wet and slippery
from the falling spray, would be impossible to all but the feet of a
mountaineer. Each of these did Hans now surmount with all the precision
and care of waking senses; with greater courage, by far, than in his
waking moments he could have confronted them.
</p>
<p>
Gorges he never gazed on before without a shudder, he passed now in utter
disregard; paths he trembled to tread, he stepped along now in nimble
speed, and at last caught sight of a large dark object that stood out
against the sky&mdash;the great heap of fire-wood for the beacon.
</p>
<p>
As he came nearer, his eagerness grew greater; each minute now seemed an
hour&mdash;every false step he made appeared to him as though it might
prove fatal to his mission; and when, by any turn of the way, the beacon
pile disappeared for a moment from his eyes, his heart throbbed so
powerfully as almost to impede his breath. At last he gained the top&mdash;the
wild mountain-peak of the Kaiser-fells. The Snow lay deep, and a cold,
cutting wind swept the drift along, and made the sensation far more
intense. Hans cared not for this: his whole soul was on one object;
suffering, torture, death itself, he would have braved and welcomed, could
he only accomplish it. The mist lay heavily on the side by which he had
ascended, but towards Landeck the air was clear, and Hans gazed down in
that direction as well as the darkness would permit; but all seemed
tranquil&mdash;nothing stirred, nor shewed the threatened approach. &ldquo;What
if he should be mistaken?&rdquo; thought Hans. &ldquo;What if the lame soldier should
have only fancied this? or could he be a traitor, that would endeavour by
a false alarm to excite the revolt before its time?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
These were torturing doubts, and while he yet revolved them he stood
unconsciously peering into the depth below, when suddenly, close beneath
him&mdash;so close that he thought it almost beside him, though still
about eighty yards off&mdash;he saw two figures emerge from the shadow of
a pine copse, and commence the steep ascent of the peak. They were
followed by two others, and now a long compact line issued forth, and
began to clamber up pass. Their weapons clinked as they came: there the
could be no doubt of it&mdash;they were the enemy!
</p>
<p>
With one spring he seized the tinder-box and struck the light: the wood,
smeared with tar, ignited when touched, and before a minute elapsed a
bright pillar of flame sprung up into the dark sky. Hans, not content with
leaving any thing to chance, seized a brand and touched the fagots here
and there, till the whole reeking mass blazed out&mdash;a perfect column
of fire.
</p>
<p>
No sooner had the leading files turned the cliff, than with a cry of
horror and vengeance they sprang forward. It was too late: the signal was
already answered from the Kaiser-fells, and a glittering star on the
Gebatsch told where another fire was about to blaze forth. Hans had but
time to turn and fly down the mountain as the soldiers drew up. A particle
of burning wood had touched his jacket, however, and, guided by the
sparks, four bullets followed him. It was at the moment when he had turned
for a last look at the blazing pile. He fell, but, speedily regaining his
feet, continued his flight. His mission was but half accomplished if the
village were not apprised of their danger. All the dangers of his upward
course were now to be encountered in his waking state; and with the agony
of a terrible wound&mdash;for the bullet had pierced him beneath the left
breast&mdash;half frantic with pain and excitement, he bounded from cliff
to cliff, clearing the torrents by leaps despair alone could have made,
and at length staggered rather than ran along the village street, and fell
at the door of the Vorsteher&rsquo;s house.
</p>
<p>
Already the whole village was a-foot: the signal blazing on the mountain
had called them to arm, but none could tell by whom it was lighted, or by
which path the enemy might be expected. They now gathered around the poor
boy, who, in accents broken and faltering, could scarce reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! thou hast done it?&rdquo; cried the Vorsteher, angrily. &ldquo;So, then, thou
silly fool, it is to thy mad ravings we owe all this terror&mdash;a terror
that may cost our country bitter tears! Who prompted thee to this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The lame soldier told me they were coming,&rdquo; said Hans, with eyes swimming
in tears.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The lame soldier!&mdash;he is mad!&rdquo; cried an old peasant: &ldquo;there is none
such in all the Dorf.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; reiterated Hans; &ldquo;they flung him away last night, because he
was lame&mdash;lame, and a cripple like me: but he told me they were
coming; and I had only time to reach the Kaiser-fells when they gained the
top too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wretched fool!&rdquo; said the Vorsteher, sternly; &ldquo;thy mad reading and wild
fancies have ruined the Vaterland. See, there is the signal from Pfunds,
and the whole Tyrol will be up! If thy life were worth anything, thou
shouldst die for this!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So shall I!&rdquo; said Hans, sobbing; &ldquo;the bullet is yet here.&rdquo; And he opened
his jacket, and displayed to their horrified gaze the whole chest bathed
in blood, and the round, blue mark of a gun-shot wound.
</p>
<p>
This terrible evidence dispelled every doubt of Hans&rsquo; story: all its
strange incoherency vanished before that pool of blood, which, welling
forth at every respiration, ran in currents over him. Dreadful, too, as
the tidings were, the better nature of the poor villagers prevailed over
their fears, and in the sorrow the child&rsquo;s fate excited all other thoughts
were lost.
</p>
<p>
In a sad procession they bore him home to his mother&rsquo;s cottage, the
Vorsteher walking at his side; while Hans, with rapid utterance, detailed
the events which have been told. Broken and unconnected as parts of his
recital were&mdash;incomprehensible as the whole history of the lame
soldier appeared&mdash;the wounded figure&mdash;the blazing fires that
already twinkled on every peak,&mdash;were facts too palpable for denial;
and the hearers stared at each other in amazement, not knowing how to
interpret the strange story.
</p>
<p>
The agonising grief of the bereaved mother, as she beheld the shattered
and bleeding form of her child, broke in upon these doubtings; and while
they endeavoured to offer her their consolation, none thought of the
impending danger.
</p>
<p>
For a while after he was laid in bed, Hans seemed sunk in a swoon; but,
suddenly awakening, he made an effort to rise. Too weak for this, he
called the chief people of the village around, and said,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are coming from the Kaiser-fells; they will be down soon, and burn
the village, if you do not cut away the bridges over the Kletscher, and
close the pass on the Weissen Spitze. Throw out skirmishers along the
mountain side, and guard the footpath from the Pontlatzer Brücke.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Had the words been the dying orders of a general commanding an army, they
could not have been heard with more implicit reverence, nor more strictly
obeyed. From the spot the Vorsteher issued commands for these instructions
to be followed. Hans&rsquo; revelations were, to the superstitious imaginations
of the peasants, of divine inspiration: and many already stoutly affirmed
that the lame soldier was St. Martin himself, their patron saint, at whose
shrine a crowd of devout worshippers were soon after seen kneeling.
</p>
<p>
The village doctor soon pronounced the case above his skill, but did not
abandon hope. Hans only smiled faintly, and whispered,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Be it so! The proverb is always right,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
‘Gott hat sein plan Für Jedenmann.&rsquo;
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you see there, Herr Vorsteher?&rdquo; cried he, as the old man stared
with astonished eyes from the little window that commanded the valley.
&ldquo;What is it you see?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Dorf in the Kaunser-Thal seems all in commotion,&rdquo; answered the
Vorsteher. &ldquo;The people are packing every thing in their waggons, and
preparing to fly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Hans, quietly; &ldquo;I saw it already.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thou hast seen it already?&rdquo; muttered the old man, in trembling awe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I saw it all. Look sharply along the river side, and tell me if a
child is not holding two mules, who are striving to get down into the
stream to drink.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;God be around and about us!&rdquo; murmured the Vorsteher; &ldquo;his power is
great!&rdquo; He crossed himself three times, and the whole company followed the
pious motion; and a low, murmuring prayer, was heard to fill the chamber.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is a waggon with eight bullocks, too, but they cannot stir the
load,&rdquo; continued Hans, as, with closed eyes, he spoke with the faint
accents of one half-sleeping.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who are these coming along the valley, Hans?&rdquo; asked the Vorsteher; &ldquo;they
seem like our own Jagers, as well as my eyes can make out.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is asleep!&rdquo; whispered his mother, with a cautious gesture to enforce
silence.
</p>
<p>
It was true. Wearied, and faint, and dying, he had fallen into slumber.
</p>
<p>
While poor Hans slept, the tidings of which he was the singular messenger
had received certain confirmation. The village scouts had already
exchanged shots with the Bavarian troops upon the mountains, and driven
them back. The guard at the Pontlatzer Brücke was seen to withdraw up the
valley towards Landeck, escorting three field-pieces which had only
arrived the preceding day. Every moment accounts came of garrisons
withdrawn from distant outpost stations, and troops falling back to
concentrate in the open country. It was seen, from various circumstances,
that a forward movement had been intended, and was only thwarted by the
inexplicable intervention of Hans Jörgle.
</p>
<p>
The Tyrolers could not fail to perceive that their own hour was now come,
and the blow must be struck at once or never! So felt the leaders; and
scarcely had the Bavarians withdrawn their advanced posts, than emissaries
flew from village to village, with little scraps of paper, bearing the
simple words, &ldquo;<i>Es ist zeit!</i>&mdash;It is time!&rdquo; while, as the day
broke, a little plank was seen floating down the current, with a small
flag-staff, from which a pennon fluttered&mdash;a signal that was welcomed
by the wildest shouts of enthusiasm as it floated along:&mdash;the Tyrol
was up! &ldquo;<i>Fur Gott, der Kaiser, und das Vaterland!</i>&rdquo; rung from every
glen and every mountain.
</p>
<p>
I dare not suffer myself to be withdrawn, even for a moment, to that
glorious struggle&mdash;one of the noblest that ever a nation carried on
to victory. My task is rather within that darkened room in the little hut,
where, with fast-ebbing life, Hans Jörgle lay.
</p>
<p>
The wild cheers and echoing songs of the marching peasants awoke him from
his sleep, which, if troubled by pangs of pain, had still lasted for some
hours. He smiled, and made a gesture as if for silence, that he might hear
the glorious sounds more plainly, and then lay in a calm, peaceful
reverie, for a considerable time.
</p>
<p>
The Vorsteher had, with considerable difficulty, persuaded the poor widow
to leave the bedside for a moment, while he asked Hans a question.
</p>
<p>
The wretched mother was borne, almost fainting, away; and the old man sat
in her place, but, subdued by the anguish of the scene, unable to speak.
At last, while the tears ran down his aged cheeks, he kissed the child&rsquo;s
hand, and said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thou wilt leave us soon, Hans!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Hans gave a smile of sad, but beautiful meaning, while his upturned eyes
seemed to intimate his hope and his faith.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;True, Hans&mdash;thy reward is ready for thee!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He paused a second, and then went on:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But even here, my child, in our own poor village, let thy devotion be a
treasure, to be handed down in memory to our children, that they may know
how one like themselves&mdash;more helpless, too&mdash;could serve his
Vaterland. Say, Hans Jörgle, will it make thy last moments happier to
think that our gratitude will raise a monument to thee in the Dorf, with
thy father&rsquo;s name, who fell at Elchingen, above thine own? The villagers
have bid me ask thee this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My mother&mdash;my poor mother!&rdquo; murmured Hans.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She shall never want, Hans Jörgle. The best house in the Dorf shall not
have a better fireside than hers. But my question, Hans&mdash;time
presses.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Hans was silent, and lay with closed eyes for several minutes; then,
laying his hand on the old man, he spoke with an utterance clear at first,
but which gradually grew fainter as he proceeded,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let them build no monument to one poor and humble as I am; mine were not
actions glorious enough for trophies in the noon-day; but let the
‘Nachtwachter&rsquo; come here at midnight&mdash;at the same hour of my blessed
dream&mdash;and let him wish me a good night. They who are sleeping will
dream happier; and the waking will think, as they hear the cry, of Hans
Jörgle!&rdquo;
